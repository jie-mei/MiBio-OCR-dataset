BIRDS
OF
GREAT
BRITAIN
AND
IRELAND
ORDER
PASSERES
FAMILY
ORIOLID^
.
THIS
famil}^
consists
of
a
tropical
group
of
brightly
coloured
birds
in
whicli
yellow
and
black
,
or
scarlet
and
black
,
are
the
prevailing
hues
.
Although
in
the
general
form
of
their
heads
they
somewhat
remind
one
of
Starlings
,
they
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
so-called
"
Orioles
"
of
the
New
World
,
which
belong
to
the
family
IdcridcE
or
Hang-nests
and
Troupials
,
a
group
of
birds
linking
the
Finches
and
the
Starlings
,
and
feeding
largely
upon
seeds
and
insects
.
The
late
Henry
Seebohm
was
of
opinion
that
the
Orioles
were
nearly
related
to
the
Crows
;
he
,
therefore
,
placed
the
genus
Oriolus
in
his
Subfamily
Corvince
,
from
which
he
said
that
they
chiefly
differed
in
their
exposed
nostrils
,
although
he
admitted
that
the
tarsus
might
perhaps
be
slightly
shorter
,
and
the
prevailing
colours
different
;
whilst
the
sexes
also
were
dissimilar
.
*
In
addition
to
the
above
distinctive
characters
,
the
third
primary
of
the
wing
(
not
the
fourth
or
fifth
)
appears
to
be
the
longest
,
in
the
Orioles
;
whilst
the
whole
character
of
the
nest
,
which
Seebohm
often
made
much
of
iu
his
classifi-↵cation
,
is
quite
unlike
that
of
a
Crow
;
being
neatly
woven
,
and
slung
like
a
hammock
between
the
forks
of
a
branch
:
moreover
,
whereas
the
eggs
of
the
Crows
are
usually
of
some
shade
of
green
or
blue
,
heavily
spotted
and
speckled
,
or
blotched
and
mottled
,
with
various
shades
of
olive
or
brown
,
those
of
the
Orioles
vary
from
white
to
salmon-pink
,
clearly
spotted
with
blackish-brown
,
and
some-↵times
with
lilacine-greyisli
shell-markings
.
The
call-notes
and
songs
of
the
Orioles
are
bright
and
melodious
;
but
this
fact
would
not
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
dissociating
them
from
the
Crows
;
although
our
native
species
of
Corvidcr
do
not
shine
as
whistlers
,
in
their
wild
state
.
I
think
,
however
,
that
Howard
Saunders
was
fully
justified
in
adopting
the
present
family
for
the
Orioles
.

BREEDS
in
suitable
localities
throughout
Europe
south
of
the
Baltic
and
in
Algeria
;
passes
through
Greece
,
Asia
Minor
,
Palestine
,
Egypt
,
and
Nubia
,
on
migration
;
and
winters
in
North
Africa
,
south-eastwards
to
Madagascar
,
Natal
,
and
westwards
to
Damara
Land
:
stragglers
sometimes
occur
in
Madeira
,
and
the
Azores
.
The
Golden
Oriole
is
a
regular
visitor
to
our
shores
in
spring
,
the
largest
number
having
been
seen
in
the
Scilly
Islands
,
and
Cornwall
;
it
has
,
however
,
been
met
with
in
not
a
few
of
the
southern
and
south-eastern
counties
,
and
several
instances
of
its
breeding
with
us
have
been
recorded
.
In
1868
,
I
saw
a
male
specimen
of
this
bird
near
Linton
,
in
Devonshire
,
and
in
July
,
1887
,
I
was
just
too
late
to
see
the
species
in
Essex
;
Mr.
Fitch
,
of
Maldon
(
whom
I
was
visiting
)
informed
me
that
the
bird
had
been
seen
in
one
of
his
thickets
during
the
previous
week
.
We
visited
the
place
iu
the
hope
of
discovering
a
uest
,
but
were
unsuc-↵cessful
.
In
Ireland
it
has
chiefly
occurred
on
the
east
coast
,
most
of
the
examples
being
females
,
or
immature
males
;
a
specimen
was
recorded
as
shot
in
the
Faroe
Islands
,
in
Maj^
1893
,
by
Col.
H.
W.
Feildeu
.
In
June
,
1906
,
one
was
killed
by
a
cat
on
the
Marine
Parade
at
Brighton
.
Perhaps
the
nearest
point
to
London
at
which
it
has
been
recognized
,
was
noted
in
the
"
Zoologist
"
for
1892
,
an
example
having
apparently
been
seen
in
Richmond
Park
.
The
male
of
this
species
is
bright
gamboge-yellow
,
the
lores
,
wings
(
excepting
the
terminal
third
of
the
primary-coverts
)
and
a
great
part
of
the
tail
black
;
the
primaries
,
excepting
the
two
outermost
,
are
edged
externally
,
and
the
secondaries
are
tipped
with
j^ellowish-white
;
the
two
central
tail-feathers
are
yellowish
at
the
base
,
and
yellow
at
the
tip
,
and
the
other
feathers
have
the
terminal
third
of
the
outer
webs
,
and
borders
of
the
inner
webs
yellow
;
bill
reddish-ochreous
;
feet
leaden-grey
;
iris
bright
red
.
The
female
is
much
duller
than
the
male
,
greener
,
and
with
the
black
colouring
replaced
by
deep
brown
;
the
throat
,
breast
,
and
centre
of
belly
whitish
;
the
throat
,
breast
,
and
flanks
streaked
with
greyish
.
Young
birds
are
greener
and
browner
than
the
female
,
but
otherwise
similar
;
nestlings
have
the
upper
parts
olivaceous
,
spotted
with
yellow
.
The
Golden
Oriole
frequents
gardens
,
groves
,
plantations
,
thickets
,
and
the
outskirts
of
large
woods
,
especially
in
the
neighbourhood
of
water
;
it
seems
to
prefer
the
haunts
of
man
,
yet
is
so
shy
that
it
rarely
remains
in
view
for
more
than
a
minute
as
it
flies
rapidly
,
in
somewhat
Thrush-like
,
though
more
undulating
fashion
,
from
cover
to
cover
;
choosing
ever
the
densest
foliage
,
as
if
aware
of
the
perilous
brilliance
of
its
plumage
:
possibly
it
may
slowly
be
acquiring
a
hereditary
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
,
if
but
a
glimpse
is
obtained
of
it
,
an
attempt
at
least
is
made
to
put
an
end
to
its
life
;
or
if
it
fails
to
comprehend
so
much
,
it
may
inherit
a
dread
of
the
thunder
and
lightning
which
,
for
generations
,
have
heralded
its
appearance
:
birds
are
not
naturally
fearful
of
man
;
for
even
those
which
have
been
taught
by
their
parents
to
dread
him
,
can
be
generally
converted
by
gentleness
and
petting
:
moreover
the
fact
that
a
grown
man
can
tame
a
small
bird
,
whereas
even
the
tamest
will
always
show
the
greatest
fear
of
a
little
boy
,
certainly
seems
to
prove
that
the
instinctive
dread
of
the
monkey-nature
in
the
latter
is
deeply
implanted
in
all
birds
;
j ust
as
is
that
of
a
cat
,
even
though
that
animal
may
never
have
been
seen
by
the
bird
previously
.
*
The
nest
of
the
Golden
Oriole
is
nsually
,
though
not
invariably
,
suspended
between
the
forking
branches
of
an
oak
,
frequently
at
a
considerable
height
from
the
ground
,
and
at
the
end
of
a
somewhat
slender
bough
.
The
outer
walls
are
formed
of
broad-leaved
sedges
,
grasses
,
strips
of
bark
(
often
white
birch-bark
)
wool
etc.
,
carefully
interwoven
,
and
including
the
branches
between
which
it
hangs
;
the
lining
consists
of
fii:e
grasses
,
sometimes
with
the
flowering
heads
attached
.
The
eggs
,
which
number
from
four
to
five
,
are
shining
milk-white
,
with
scattered
pur-↵plish
black
spots
,
and
occasionall}'
a
few
greyish
shell-spots
.
The
season
of
nidification
appears
to
be
from
May
to
June
.
The
call-note
of
this
bird
is
clear
and
flute-like
,
but
its
alarm-note
is
a
harsh
croaking
khrr
:
the
song
is
short
but
melodious
:
Seebohm
renders
it

The
Rev
.
H.
A.
IMacphersou
states
that
the
males
have
a
cat-like
call
:
he
also
observes
(
Zoologist
,
1891
,
p.
467
)
after
noting
the
fact
that
the
females
as
they
grow
older
approach
the
male
colouring
:
—
"
I
do
not
think
that
the
female
of
this
Oriole
would
be
at
all
exposed
to
danger
when
sitting
by
bright
colours
.
It
is
not
eas}'
to
see
even
a
male
Golden
Oriole
in
the
top
of
a
big
oak
or
elm
in
the
breeding
season
.
The
birds
crouch
close
to
the
boughs
if
alarmed
,
and
neither
they
nor
their
nests
are
easy
to
distinguish
among
the
fully
expanded
leaves
.
"
The
food
of
this
bird
consists
largel}'
of
insects
and
their
larvae
,
spiders
,
and
the
like
;
but
as
the
fruit
season
approaches
,
its
diet
somewhat
changes
,
cherries
being
especially
relished
b}^
it
:
in
confinement
it
does
well
on
the
usual
food
for
insectivorous
birds
.
Being
both
beautiful
and
musical
it
is
much
esteemed
as
a
cage-bird
,
and
years
ago
I
asked
a
friend
to
obtain
nestlings
for
me
;
but
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
he
did
not
succeed
in
securing
me
an}'
,
for
they
seem
not
to
be
easy
to
bring
up
.
Lord
Lilford
remarks
:
—
"
I
have
found
the
young
very
difficult
to
keep
alive
for
more
than
a
week
or
two
,
though
I
know
of
instances
in
which
they
have
been
reared
with
success
.
"
I
think
it
extremelj'
probable
that
aviculturists
,
when
tr3'ing
to
rear
insecti-↵vorous
birds
,
feed
them
far
too
well
:
in
the
case
of
large
birds
like
Thrushes
,
Starlings
,
or
Orioles
,
I
believe
that
the
mixture
on
which
I
have
always
been
successful
in
rearing
the
two
former
,
would
answer
well
for
all
three
—
oat-flour
,
fine
peameal
,
and
sifted
Spratt
's
food
(
or
ground
dog-biscuit
)
;
but
in
the
case
of
the
Orioles
,
it
might
be
advantageousl}'
varied
with
soaked
ants
'
cocoons
,
or
living
ants
'
cocoons
if
readil}--
procurable
.
Some
years
ago
I
had
a
specimen
of
this
bird
sent
to
me
;
unhappil}-
it
was
blind
in
one
eye
;
whether
this
affliction
affected
it
or
not
I
can
not
say
,
but
,
to
the
day
of
its
death
(
which
occurred
about
two
years
later
)
,
I
found
it
the
dullest
and
most
apathetic
bird
I
ever
kept
;
once
or
twice
I
heard
its
clear
bright
whistle
,
but
as
a
rule
it
might
as
well
have
been
stuffed
for
all
the
interest
it
seemed
to
take
in
life
.
The
Orioles
in
coniinement
do
not
differ
from
other
insectivors
in
their
pas-↵sionate
love
of
both
mealworms
and
spiders
,
and
a
few
of
either
every
da}'
are
not
only
wholesome
,
but
tend
to
tame
them
if
they
need
it
.
FAMILY
LANIID^
.
THE
Shrikes
or
Butcher-birds
form
a
large
and
well-defined
group
of
birds
of
somewhat
predaceous
habits
,
strong
in
their
bills
,
but
comparatively
weak
in
their
claws
,
which
,
nevertheless
,
they
use
for
striking
at
and
grasping
their
prey
.
The
mandibles
are
short
and
thick
,
the
upper
one
with
curved
culmen
always
with
a
tolerable
well-defiued
terminal
hook
,
preceded
,
on
the
inferior
or
cutting
edge
,
by
a
slight
sinus
,
behind
which
is
a
prominent
wedge-shaped
tooth
;
the
nostrils
are
oval
,
lateral
,
and
basal
,
and
there
are
well-defiued
rictal
bristles
,
as
in
the
Flycatchers
.
Dr.
Hans
Gadow
greatly
extends
the
family
,
to
include
many
types
,
observing
that
the
diagnosis
of
the
Laniidcv
*
*
as
given
by
Mr.
Sharpe
*
*
is
applicable
to
Lanius
only
:
he
,
however
,
admits
that
the
family
,
as
defined
by
himself
,
contains
some
very
aberrant
forms
,
and
I
think
all
naturalists
will
agree
that
this
should
not
be
the
case
if
there
is
an}'
way
of
avoiding
it
.
Families
,
Subfamilies
,
and
genera
are
conveniences
,
and
the
more
sharply
they
can
be
defined
,
the
more
convenient
they
are
;
it
is
far
better
to
have
a
small
and
compact
family
,
than
a
large
and
heterogeneous
one
.
Dr.
Gadow
observes
in
his
Catalogue
that
"
The
Laniida:
,
as
described
in
this
volume
,
form
neither
a
group
complete
in
itself
,
nor
are
the
lines
of
distinction
always
drawn
closely
enough
.
"
Most
of
the
Shrikes
are
inhabitants
of
the
Old
World
:
in
Great
Britain
they
are
represented
by
the
typical
genus
Lanius
alone
—
a
group
which
contains
alto-↵gether
about
forty
species
,
four
of
which
have
been
obtained
on
our
shores
,
though
only
two
of
these
appear
to
breed
with
us
.
Some
authorities
consider
the
Shrikes
to
be
uearlj^
related
to
the
Crows
;
in-↵deed
Seebohni
made
them
a
Subfamily
close
to
tlie
Corvi)ia
,
although
he
admitted
that
their
"
exact
affinities
are
very
difficult
to
determine
"
;
he
considered
that
they
approached
the
Crows
in
the
form
of
their
bills
,
the
strong
bristles
,
and
short
feathers
partly
covering
the
nostrils
,
and
in
their
feet
.
Howard
Saunders
,
from
the
position
which
he
assigns
to
them
in
liis
}ilanual
,
seems
to
regard
them
as
more
nearly
related
to
the
Flj-catchers
.

ORNITHOLOGISTS
differ
in
opinion
as
to
whether
this
biixl
is
distinct
from
Pallas
's
Grey
Shrike
(
with
the
single
white
bar
on
the
wing
)
:
Seebohm
con-↵sidered
the
two
forms
as
distinct
as
the
Carrion
and
Hooded
Crows
,
but
Mr.
Howard
Saunders
brought
forward
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
they
had
but
little
claim
to
the
title
of
separate
species
.
In
his
Manual
we
read
:
—
"
Many
of
the
specimens
obtained
in
winter
have
a
white
bar
on
the
primaries
only
,
the
bases
of
tlie
secondaries
being
black
;
whereas
in
the
typical
L.
cxcubitor
the
bases
of
the
secondaries
are
white
,
and
the
wing
exhibits
a
double
bar
.
The
form
with
only
one
bar
is
the
L.
viajor
,
of
Pallas
,
and
,
as
shown
by
Prof.
Collett
(
Ibis
,
1886
,
pp
.
30-40
)
it
meets
and
interbreeds
with
L.
exaibiior
in
Scandinavia
,
t3'pical
examples
of
both
races
being
actually
found
in
the
same
brood
,
while
intermediate
forms
are
not
uncommon
.
Where
the
sexes
have
been
determined
,
the
double-↵barred
bird
has
generally
proved
to
be
a
male
,
and
the
single-barred
a
female
.
Dr.
Hartert
does
not
regard
L.
major
as
a
distinct
species
.
Typical
L.
excubitor
breeds
as
far
east
as
St.
Petersburg
,
beyond
which
,
in
Siberia
,
L.
major
becomes
the
representative
form
.
In
tlie
valley
of
Yenesei
,
the
latter
meets
,
but
does
not
interbreed
with
the
whiter
winged
L.
Icncopterus
;
the
last
ranging
through
Turkestan
to
vSouthern
Russia
,
where
,
by
its
union
with
the
typical
Z
.
cxcubitor
,
it
seems
to
have
produced
an
intermediate
race
,
known
as
L.

The
Great
Grey
Shrike
is
a
tolerably
frequent
visitor
to
Great
Britain
in
autumn
and
winter*
:
it
is
also
sometimes
met
with
in
England
in
tlie
summer
;
indeed
,
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
when
out
birds'-nesting
with
a
keen
old
student
of
nature
—
Dr.
John
Grayling
,
of
Sittingbourue
,
he
has
called
my
attention
to
a
specimen
of
this
species
,
conspicuous
by
its
pied
colouring
:
there
is
,
however
,
no
satisfactory
evidence
that
it
has
nested
in
the
British
Isles
,

taken
somewhere
about
the
j-ear
1880
by
Mr.
John
Woodgate
,
at
Hadley
(
Herts
.
)
certainly
looks
remarkably
like
that
of
L.
(xcubitoy
.
The
adult
male
of
this
species
is
of
a
pale
bluish
ash
grey-above
,
this
colour
becoming
paler
on
the
rump
and
upper
tail-coverts
;
forehead
,
a
line
over
each
eye
,
and
the
scapulars
white
;
wing
black
,
with
white
bases
and
tips
to
the
flights
;
central
tail
feathers
black
,
outer
feathers
white
,
intermediate
feathers
grading
between
the
two
colours
;
under
surface
white
;
flanks
slightly
greyish
;
the
lores
,
cheeks
,
and
ear-coverts
black
:
bill
black
,
the
lower
mandible
paler
at
the
base
;
feet
black
;
iris
dark
brown
.
The
female
chiefly
differs
from
the
male
in
its
slightly
duller
colouring
,
and
in
having
the
neck
and
breast
barred
with
greyish-brown
.
The
young
are
dull
grey
above
,
and
dull-white
below
,
the
barring
of
the
underparts
extending
over
the
bell}-
;
the
bill
and
feet
are
also
paler
than
in
the
adults
.
The
flight
of
this
bird
,
as
judged
by
the
two
or
three
specimens
which
I
have
seeu
,
is
somewhat
wild
and
undulating
:
in
its
habits
it
resembles
the
common
Red-backed
species
,
keeping
much
to
the
open
countr}^
the
outskirts
of
woods
,
or
to
hedgerows
;
when
noticed
it
was
in
each
case
just
leaving
a
bare
projecting
branch
of
a
tree
;
the
first
specimen
close
to
a
wood
in
the
Stockbury
Valley
,
the
second
near
Dover
.
The
food
of
the
Great
Grey
Shrike
consists
of
good
sized
insects
,
new-born
birds
,
or
adult
birds
of
such
genera
as
Parus.
or
Regiilus
,
frogs
,
lizards
,
slow-worms
,
mice
,
etc
.
:
it
is
more
raptorial
than
the
Red-backed
Shrike
;
and
,
not
only
some-↵times
hunts
down
and
hovers
over
its
pre}^
but
even
holds
it
down
on
a
branch
and
deliberately
picks
it
to
pieces
after
the
manner
of
a
hawk
;
though
,
as
a
rule
,
it
spits
it
on
a
thorn
after
the
fashion
of
its
kind
.
The
nest
is
usually
placed
at
a
much
greater
height
from
the
ground
than
that
of
our
common
British
species
,
viz
:
—
at
from
ten
to
thirty
feet
,
in
the
forked
branch
of
an
olive
,
apple
,
pear
,
oak
,
or
fir
tree
;
it
is
bulk}'
,
and
large
as
that
of
a
Blackbird
,
and
is
formed
of
twigs
,
Ijcnts
,
dead
leaves
,
green
grass
,
and
moss
;
the
lining
consisting
of
rootlets
,
wool
,
hair
,
and
feathers
.
The
eggs
number
from
five
to
seven
,
usually
five
,
and
vary
from
creamy
to
bluish
white
,
with
lighter
or
darker
olivaceous
spots
aud
blotches
,
frequently
forming
a
well-defined
zone
just
above
the
middle
,
and
accompanied
by
lilac-grey
shell-markings
;
sometimes
they
form
a
large
patch
at
one
end
(
usually
the
larger
one
)
.
Nidification
as
a
rule
commences
about
the
middle
of
May
;
incubation
lasts
fifteen
days
;
aud
,
during
the
rearing
of
the
young
,
this
species
is
most
courageous
in
their
defence
,
driving
away
even
the
Crow-family
from
the
vicinity
of
its
nest
.

"
This
bird
,
though
very
cautious
in
general
,
is
yet
not
unfre-↵qnently
caught
in
the
throstle
bush
;
that
,
however
,
such
a
fate
is
well
deserved
,
is
shown
by
the
discovery
of
many
a
poor
little
Redbreast
with
its
brains
hacked
out
,
the
work
of
this
ruthless
aggressor
.
I
have
even
on
one
occasion
seen
a
Blackbird
,
as
it
was
hastening
along
over
the
grass
,
pounced
upon
by
one
of
these
daring
robbers
,
and
succumb
,
after
a
short
struggle
,
to
the
bites
of
his
assailant
.
"
Lord
Lilford
says
that
about
the
end
of
December
,
1880
,
he
received
a
fine
young
bird
of
this
species
alive
:
it
had
been
taken
by
means
of
bird-lime
near
Glendow
,
on
November
19th
;
he
kept
this
bird
alive
for
some
months
.
Herr
Mathias
Rausch
(
Gefiederte
Welt
,
1891
,
p.
475
)
observes
that
this
bird
is
not
of
the
slightest
value
for
aviculture
as
a
singer
,
for
although
he
both
mocks
well
and
sings
industriously
,
he
,
by
his
call-notes
,
makes
the
other
singers
crazy
with
anxiety
and
fear
,
and
thereby
disturbs
them
in
their
song
.
"
One
can
only
find
it
caged
in
the
possession
of
peculiar
fanciers
,
who
mostly
aim
at
completeness
,
in
respect
of
all
birds
belonging
to
this
category
.
"
*
From
a
long
study
of
birds
in
confinement
,
I
should
imagine
that
Herr
Rausch
speaks
here
theoretically
,
and
not
from
experience
:
if
the
cry
of
a
Shrike
in
a
cage
is
calculated
to
terrify
a
small
song-bird
in
another
cage
,
surely
the
small
song-birds
of
South
America
ought
to
be
alarmed
by
the
cries
of
the
Blue-bearded
Jay
,
or
even
those
of
the
Sulphur
Tyrant
;
yet
they
pay
no
more
heed
to
them
than
to
the
calls
of
perfectly
innocent
birds
:
I
believe
that
predaceous
species
are
recognized
by
sight
,
more
readily
than
by
their
voice
.

THIS
is
so
rare
a
straggler
,
on
migration
,
to
tlie
English
coast
,
that
I
hesitated
to
describe
it
in
the
present
work
.
In
1883
,
Seebohm
mentioned
that
onl}^
four
examples
had
been
recorded
;
and
,
at
the
end
of
i88g
,
Howard
Saunders
only
enumerated
six
:
it
has
since
occurred
at
Dorking
in
1886
;
near
Bournemouth
in
1900
;
at
Docking
(
Norfolk
)
,
in
1902
;
near
Chichester
in
1905
;
near
Whitby
in
1906
,
and
in
Bedfordshire
in
1907
:
it
is
therefore
,
perhaps
a
pity
that
a
plate
of
it
was
not
produced
;
still
if
everj^
straggler
to
our
coasts
was
depicted
it
would
add
greatly
to
the
expense
of
this

observes
that
this
species
"
is
a
summer
visitor
to
the
whole
of
the
continent
of
Europe
up
to
lat
.
64°
,
with
the
exception
of
the
Spanish
pen-↵insula
,
where
it
is
only
an
occasional
straggler
to
the
north-east
.
In
Greece
,
Asia
Minor
,
and
Palestine
,
it
is
only
found
in
the
pine-regions
.
Eastwards
its
breeding
range
extends
through
Northern
Persia
,
and
throughout
Turkestan
as
far
as
the
Altai
Mountains
.
It
passes
through
Asia
Minor
and
North-east
Africa
on
migration
.
A
few
winter
in
the
valley
of
the
Indns
;
but
the
great
stream
of
migration
appears
to
follow
the
vallej^
of
the
Nile
to
South
Africa
,
where
it
is
abundant
during
our
winter
in
Natal
,
Damara

,
the
Transvaal
,
Angola
,
and
the
Cape
Colony
.
"
In
Great
Britain
this
bird
is
common
but
local
;
though
most
abundant
in
the
southern
counties
,
it
has
rarely
been
met
with
in
Cornwall
;
in
Wales
,
and
the
central
counties
it
is
not
imcommon
,
yet
it
is
becoming
rarer
in
Norfolk
,
and
in
Lincoln-↵shire
is
almost
unknown
;
in
the
northern
counties
it
is
rare
,
probably
increasingly
so
;
to
Scotland
it
is
onl}'
a
chance
straggler
,
though
it
has
been
recorded
as
breeding
in
the
south-east
;
late
in
May
and
early
in
June
1906
several
were
observed
during
migration
at
Fair
Isle
(
Shetlands
)
.
In
Ireland
a
specimen
was
shot
in
1878
,
and
others
were
said
to
have
been
seen
at
the
same
time
.
The
upper
parts
of
the
male
are
gre}-
,
excepting
the
scapulars
and
back
which
are
chestnut-brown
;
the
wing-coverts
black
,
margined
with
chestnut
;
wings
dark
brown
,
the
feathers
edged
with
chestnut
;
the
two
middle
tail-feathers
black
,
the
rest
white
on
the
basal
half
,
black
,
edged
with
white
on
the
terminal
half
;
frontal
band
,
lores
,
and
ear-coverts
black
;
under
parts
rosy
huffish
,
whiter
on
the
chin
and
under
tail-coverts
;
bill
and
feet
black
;
iris
dark
brown
.
The
female
is
usually
quite
unlike
the
male
,
her
upper
parts
being
reddish-brown
,
slightly
barred
on
the
mantle
,
her
under
parts
buffish-white
,
barred
(
excepting
in
the
centre
)
w-ith
brown
;
there
is
no
black
on
the
head
,
but
a
pale
buff
streak
above
the
eye
.
Young
birds
are
somewhat
similar
to
the
female
,
but
whiter
on
the
forehead
,
with
ill-defined
eye-streak
,
their
upper
parts
barred
,
and
their
feet
greyer
.
The
common
Butcher-bird
reaches
us
earl}'
in
May
,
and
usually
leaves
us
again
in
August
or
September
,
although
a
late
straggler
has
been
reported
as
captured
in
November
;
it
is
,
therefore
,
probable
that
only
one
brood
is
reared
.
I
have
taken
fresh
eggs
as
late
as
the
8th
June
,
in
Kent
,
but
not
later
than
the
29th
May
,
in
Norfolk
;
in
the
latter
county
,
however
,
I
only
met
with
the
nest
twice
;
it
is
,
therefore
,
possible
that
later
nests
may
occur
;
the
first
week
in
June
appears
from
my
dates
to
be
the
earliest
laying-time
in
the
north
of
Kent
;
perhaps
a
few
nests
may
be
occupied
earlier
.
The
nest
of
this
species
is
most
frequentl}'
placed
in
a
hawthorn
bush
,
or
hedge
,
but
sometimes
in
the
fork
of
a
stunted
tree
,
seldom
more
than
five
feet
from
the
ground
,
and
frequently
less
:
the
number
of
eggs
is
usually
five
,
but
sometimes
six
.
Although
there
is
a
good
deal
of
difference
in
the
form
and
tinting
of
the
eggs
,
the
general
character
of
the
markings
is
very
characteristic
in
most
specimens
laid
by
this
bird
:
the
ground-tint
varies
from
greenish
white
to
creamy
buff
,
and
from
the
latter
colour
to
salmon-pink
;
the
spots
vary
from
olive
to
red-↵brown
,
with
underlying
spots
of
bluish-ash
;
sometimes
the
surface
spots
are
wholly
wanting
,
the
grey
markings
alone
being
in
evidence
;
the
spots
are
usually
almost
entirely
confined
to
the
broader
half
,
rarely
to
the
apical
half
;
and
,
still
more
rarely
,
irregularly
scattered
over
the
whole
surface
;
in
most
eggs
they
are
largest
,
and
form
an
irregular
zone
,
just
above
the
middle
.
In
Kent
I
found
the
pink
variety
of
the
egg
extremely
rare
,
indeed
I
only
once
succeeded
in
taking
a
full
clutch
of
this
form
by
fighting
my
way
edgeways
through
a
dense
(
six-foot
thick
)
hawthorn
hedge
,
the
hen
bird
chacking
away
,
and
making
little
frantic
rushes
at
my
fingers
,
as
I
gradually
struggled
nearer
to
the
prize
.
In
some
counties
I
am
told
that
the
pink
form
is
the
prevalent
one
;
it
certainly
is
the
prettiest
.
I
found
the
nests
of
the
Red-backed
Shrike
most
commonly
in
the
neigh-↵bourhood
of
Maidstone
;
taking
tliree
in
one
morning
from
the
forked
branches
of
stunted
trees
near
the
river
:
in
such
positions
it
was
invariably
more
solidly
built
than
when
placed
in
a
bush
or
hedge
;
in
character
it
is
not
unlike
some
nests
of
the
Greenfinch
,
but
deeper
;
the
outer
walls
formed
of
coarse
grass-stalks
and
moss
,
and
the
lining
of
fine
bents
,
wool
,
and
horsehair
.
As
is
well-known
the
name
of
Butcher-bird
has
been
given
to
this
species
owing
to
the
habit
which
it
has
,
in
common
with
other
Shrikes
,
of
impaling
its
prey
upon
thorns
,
in
order
,
it
is
said
,
more
readily
to
tear
them
to
pieces
:
*
per-↵sonally
I
have
never
found
any
of
its
victims
in
this
unpleasant
condition
,
but
hundreds
of
observers
have
done
so
.
Its
food
consists
of
insects
,
young
and
old
birds
(
even
up
to
its
own
size
)
lizards
,
and
mice
:
it
seizes
its
prey
suddenly
,
dropping
upon
it
when
unsuspecting
an
attack
;
for
,
although
a
migratory
bird
,
the
Red-backed
Shrike
is
not
very
powerful
on
the
wing
.
The
note
of
alarm
and
anger
,
as
already
hinted
,
is
a
harsh
chack
or
char
,
the
call-note
a
harsh
chirp
,
but
the
song
,
though
short
,
is
very
pleasing
.
Herr
Mathias
Rausch
says
(
Gefiederte
Welt
,
1891
,
p.
446
)
"
The
best
singer
and
mocker
among
the
rapacious
birds
is
acknowledged
to
be
the
Red-backed
Shrike
or
Thorn-piercer
(
Lanius
collurio
)
.
He
is
also
the
commonest
and
most
widely
distributed
of
all
,
inasmuch
as
he
may
be
found
in
a
wild
state
throughout
nearly
the
whole
of
Europe
.
Especially
good
and
varied
singers
are
,
however
,
only
to
be
met
with
in
regions
rich
in
birds
.
I
have
already
owned
Red-backed
Shrikes
,
which
copied
the
Nightingale
,
the
Goldeu
Oriole
,
the
Quail
,
the
Black-cap
,
the
Garden
Warbler
,
the
Icterine
Warbler
,
the
Meadow-
,
and
Tree-Pipits
,
and
Song-Thrush
perfectly
,
and
portions
of
the
songs
of
other
birds
tolerably
well
.
The
only
pity
is
that
the
voice
of
this
bird
is
so
weak
,
that
it
is
unable
to
reproduce
the
song
of
many
other
cage-birds
kept
at
the
same
time
,
but
it
always
repays
one
to
tend
and
care
for
this
songster
as
a
cage-bird
;
moreover
it
is
easily
and
cheaply
secured
,
and
also
kept
alive
without
difficult}'
.
This
bird
,
however
,
should
especially
be
secured
by
such
aviculturists
as
can
not
put
up
with
too
loud
a
bird-song
,
and
who
make
a
point
of
not
keeping
several
birds
on
account
of
their
dissimilarity
of
song
,
for
by
its
song
they
will
at
once
be
satisfied
in
both
respects
.
"
Of
course
this
savage
though
pretty
bird
should
never
be
turned
into
an
aviary
with
other
birds
,
as
it
would
undoubtedly
murder
and
devour
its
companions
,
even
though
as
large
as
itself
;
a
flight
cage
,
therefore
,
is
the
most
suitable
home
for
it
:
the
staple
food
should
consist
of
egg
,
pieces
of
cheese
,
with
the
addition
of
minced
raw
meat
,
cockroaches
,
or
other
insects
,
and
occasionally
a
dead
mouse
or
bird
:
indeed
tlie
food
for
all
the
Shrikes
should
be
almost
exactly
the
same
as
for
most
of
the
Corvincr
,
but
somewhat
less
varied
;
because
many
of
the
latter
eat
fruit
,
nuts
,
grain
,
and
even
acorns
,
greedily
,
as
well
as
the
usual
soft
food
.
In
1904
,
Dr.
Albert
Glinther
bred
this
species
from
hand-reared
birds
turned
into
an
outdoor
aviary
.
They
built
in
the
second
week
of
May
in
a
holly-bush
,
four
feet
from
the
ground
;
the
nest
was
of
the
usual
type
and
well-built
;
it
contained
five
eggs
which
were
incubated
for
fourteen
days
,
all
being
hatched
between
the
5th
and
6th
June
:
owing
to
cold
weather
all
died
and
were
removed
by
the
parents
.
By
June
24th
the
hen
was
again
sitting
on
five
eggs
;
these
hatched
on
the
7th
and
8th
Jul}^
;
two
of
these
died
young
but
the
three
others
left
the
nest
on
July
23rd
and
were
successfully
reared
.
In
the
following
year
the
same
pair
built
in
a
basket
hung
in
the
same
holly-bush
:
incubation
com-↵menced
about
June
loth
;
of
the
four
eggs
laid
,
two
were
hatched
on
the
24th
,
and
the
young
left
the
nest
on
July
loth
,
and
were
successfully
reared
.
It
is
best
to
rear
this
species
from
the
nest
;
for
then
it
is
supposed
to
become
very
tame
and
confiding
;
my
brief
experience
of
the
bird
,
caught
when
quite
young
,
aud
given
to
me
on
the
12th
August
,
1896
,
is
that
it
is
as
wild
as
any
adult
bird
,
and
cuts
itself
all
to
pieces
in
its
incessant
efforts
to
force
its
way
through
the
wires
of
its
prison
;
from
the
nature
of
its
food
its
cage
needs
constant
cleaning
,
otherwise
it
.smells
abominably
;
its
note
of
rage
,
char
,
char
,
is
frequently
uttered
,
but
nothing
else
.
As
it
will
not
now
learn
its
natural
song
,
a
few
good
performers
such
as
the
Nightingale
,
Blackcap
,
Skylark
,
Grey
Singing-finch
,
or
the
Pekin
Night-↵ingale
,
should
be
kept
in
cages
near
by
;
in
order
that
it
may
study
their
notes
.
One
advantage
in
this
bird
is
—
that
however
wild
it
may
be
,
and
however
intolerable
the
odour
of
its
cage
may
be
,
the
bird
always
appears
to
enjoy
robust
health
.
Even
if
one
is
ill
,
and
perchance
no
fresh
food
is
supplied
to
this
bird
for
twenty-four
hours
,
he
makes
no
trouble
of
that
,
but
only
attacks
his
food
more
vigorously
when
the
opportunity
comes
.
Moreover
,
having
by
foolish
behaviour
so
reduced
his
wings
that
he
can
not
reach
his
perch
,
he
contentedly
passes
the
night
on
a
box
in
a
corner
.
These
are
redeeming
points
in
his
character
.

HOWARD

observes
that
"
On

breeds
as
far
to
the
north-east
as
the
line
of
the
Baltic

the

of
the
Vistula

southward
it

distributed
throughout
Europe

in
the
countries
bordering
on

is
very
abundant
.
Even
there
,
however

it

arriving
about

"
To

this

is
an
irregular

,
and
principally
on
migration
;
nevertheless
about
thirty-seven
examples
have
been
obtained
in
various
parts
of
England
,
chiefly
in
the
southern

one

was

in

and
,
on

it
has
been
recorded
as

hannts
chiefly
open

;
but
in

,
from
what
Dixon
says
,
it
appears
to
frequent
the
open
spaces
in

of
evergreen

;
and
Lord
Lilford
observes
(

,
p.
78
)
"
In
Southern
Spain
,
where
the
Woodchat
is
a
very
common
summer
visitor
,
it
is
to
be
met
with
in
all
sorts
of
localities
—
the
outskirts
of
woods
,
olive-groves
,
gardens
,
and
occasionally
the
great
open
treeless
plains
,
where
the
tall
thistles
alone
offer
it
a
perch
or
look-out
station
.
In
general
habits
it
much
resembles
the
Red-backed
Shrike
,
but
so
far
as
I
know
does
not
attack
small
birds
,
which
show
no
fear
of
it
as
they
do
of
the
former
bird
.
"
Seebohm
,
speaking
of
the
food
of
the
Woodchat
,
says
that
it
"
is
composed
of
beetles
,
grasshoppers
,
and
many
other
insects
,
which
,
like
the
other
Shrikes
,
it
will
spit
on
thorns
for
the
pnrpose
of
securing
them
nntil
the}-
are
eaten
.
It
is
often
seen
on
the
wing
,
like
a
Flycatcher
;
and
when
the
capture
of
an
insect
is
made
it
returns
to
its
old
perching
place
,
ever
watchful
for
an
object
for
a
fresh
sally
into
the
air
.
"
The
nest
of
this
species
is
placed
in
the
fork
of
a
low
tree
;
it
is
formed
of
coarse
bents
and
grasses
,
sometimes
intermingled
with
cudweed
(
Gnaplialiuni
J
and
wool
;
the
lining
is
either
formed
of
fine
grasses
and
moss
,
or
of
the
flowers
of
cudweed
mixed
with
a
few
leaves
and
a
little
vegetable
wool
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
usuallj^
five
,
and
somewhat
resemble
those
of
the
Red-backed
Shrike
,
but
are
usually
slightly
larger
;
the
reddish
variety

,
in
the
better
known

,
is

Speaking
of
the
Woodchat
in
Malta
,
Mr.
C.
A.
Wright
(
Ibis
,
1894
,
p.
59
)
says
:
—
"
Perched
on
the
uppermost
twig
of
some
tree
,
its
shining
white
breast
forms
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
objects
in
the
ornithological
landscape
in
April
.
On
the
first
appearance
of
danger
,
it
flies
off"
to
anotlier
and
more
distant
tree
,
and
,
taking
np
a
similarly
elevated
position
,
scans
the
countr}-
ronnd
till
the
danger
which
had
excited
its
alarm
has
passed
away
.
It
builds
here
in
May
and
June
,
constructing
a
compact
and
well-formed
nest
in
the
fork
of
a
carob
or
almond-tree
.
Its
aff"ection
for
,
and
the
courage
it
display's
in
the
protection
of
,
its
young
are
remarkable
.
Wary
as
it
is
at
other
times
,
on
these
occasions
it
seems
to
lose
all
fear
;
uttering
piercing
cries
,
it
will
fly
close
round
the
head
of
the
intruder
,
and
actually
make
a
feint
of
dashing
in
his
face
.
"
Howard
Saunders
saj'S
:
—
"
The
note
usually
heard
is
a
harsh
laali
,
kack
,
ki-ah
;
but
the
male
has
also
a
low
and
rather
pretty
song
in
spring
,
and
shows
great
capacity
for
imitating
the
notes
of
other
birds
.
"
Seebohm
observes
:
—
"
Its
song
is
by
no
means
unmusical
,
and
very
gentle
to
proceed
from
such
raptorial
jaws
.
*
It
reminded
me
very
much
of
the
twittering
of
a
Swallow
,
or
the
warble
of
a
Starling
.
Some
of
its
call-notes
,
however
,
are
loud
and
harsh
enough
;
and
I
at
first
thought
it
was
imitating
the
notes
of
other
birds
,
in
order
to
attract
them
within
reach
;
but
inasmuch
as
the
greater
number
of
notes
it
apparently
imitated
were
of
birds
far
too
powerful
for
it
to
grapple
with
,
such
can
not
be
the
case
.
"
Dixon
saj'S
that
he
"
met
with
this
species
(
in
Algeria
)
in
all
parts
of
the
country
wherever
the
vegetation
was
sufficient
to
afford
it
shelter
.
"
Herr
Mathias
Rausch
says
of
the
Woodchat
Shrike
,
that
in
many
regions
it
is
somewhat
rare
,
and
it
costs
a
good
deal
of
trouble
to
obtain
a
good
bird
.
"
It
sings
louder
than
the
Red-backed
,
or
the
Lesser
Grey
Shrike
,
has
moreover
a
certain
roughness
in
its
voice
,
which
somewhat
detracts
from
its
imitations
,
and
thus
prejudices
their
distinctness
.
"
Possiblj'
it
was
this
which
led
Seebohm
to
think
that
the
cries
of
this
species
were
imitations
of
rapacious
birds
.
The
mimicry
practised
by
the
Woodchat
must
,
however
,
be
fairly
good
,
inasmuch
as
it
was
noticed
even
in
Bechstein
's
time
;
as
pointed
out
by
the
late
Charles
W'itchell
(
Evolution
of
Bird
song
,
p.
174
)
.
Herr
Rausch
considers
that
,
as
a
cage
bird
,
the
Woodchat
belongs
to
the
second
order
of
merit
(
Gefiederte
Welt
,
1891
,
p.
499
)
.
Although
rarer
than
the
Red-backed
Shrike
,
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
its
song
is
neither
so
pure
nor
so
perfect
in
its
imitative
power
;
and
,
when
one
has
to
keep
a
species
in
a
separate
cage
,
on
account
of
its
domineering
,
spiteful
,
or
even
dangerous
character
,
it
is
most
satisfactor}^
to
get
something
in
exchange
for
the
extra
trouble
required
to
preserve
it
in
health
:
therefore
,
if
I
already
possessed
Lanius
collurio
,
I
certainly
shoiild
not
covet
its
rarer
relative
.
In
coutradictiou
to
the
statement
of
Mr.
C.
A.
Wright
respecting
the
shyness
of
the
Wotxicliat
,
excepting
when
defending
its
young
,
Lord
Lilford
's
observations
are
interesting
;
for
he
states
that
the
"
Woodchat
is
a
very
familiar
and
fearless
bird
,
and
seems
often
to
prefer
the
vicinity
of
human
habitations
for
its
nest
.
In
all
its
habits
this
Shrike
seems
to
me
to
approach
closely
to
the
Fly-catchers
.

A

,
1905

FORMERLY
this
constituted
a
fairly
large
group
,
including
even
such
distinct
looking
birds
as
the
members
of
the
genus
Lioi/irix
,
birds
moreover
which
,
in
their
habits
nearly
resemble
our
Accentors
:
I
believe
,
however
,
that
the
relationship
of
the
Liothrix
to
Accentor
is
now
recognized
.
Jerdon
even
included
the
Tits
,
as
well
as
the
White-eyes
and
Accentors
,
in
the
same
family
.
Seebohm
,
who
only
admitted
one
family
for
the
Passercs
,
necessarily
regarded
the
present
group
as
a
Subfamily
"
consisting
of
birds
having
the
wing
of
a
Starling
,
the
foot
of
a
Shrike
,
and
a
bill
intermediate
between
that
of
a
Shrike
and
a
Swallow
.
They
are
probably
most
nearly
allied
to
the
Shrikes
and
the
Starlings
:
from
the
former
they
may
at
once
be
distinguished
by
the
minuteness
of
their
bastard
primary
,
their
short
tarsus
,
and
their
nearly
obsolete
rictal
bristles
.
Ornithologists
are
perhaps
justified
in
placing
them
in
a
distinct
Subfamil}^
in
consequence
of
the
shortness
of
their
tarsus
,
their
shorter
,
wider
,
and
notched
beak
,
and
the
presence
of
small
bristles
which
cover
the
nostrils
.

Although
the
species
of
Ainpelis
have
somewhat
the
flight
of
a
Starling
,
they
build
open
nests
in
the
branches
of
trees
;
and
,
in
their
actions
,
somewhat
resemble
Tits
.
In
all
probability
they
are
more
nearly
related
to
the
Shrikes
than
to
any
other
group
of
British
birds
;
but
they
are
not
predaceous
like
that
murderous
family
,
being
insectivorous
and
frugivorous
,
and
they
appear
to
have
little

song

they

AN

visitor

the
Waxwing

says

"

almost
a

bird

breeding
in

pine
regions
of

hemispheres
at
or
near
the
Arctic
circle
.
"
"
Throughout
Central
Europe
it
is
a
tolerable
regular
winter
visitor
.
It
occurs
accidently
on
Heligoland
,
and
occasionally
strays
as
far
west
as
France
,
and
as
far
south
as
Lombardy
and
Turke}'
,
but
has
not
yet

It

Siberia
,
occasionally
straying
as
far
as
Turkestan
,
Mongolia
,
North
China
,
and
the
north

.
In
America
its
winter
range
extends
as
far
south
as
Lakes

and
Erie
;
but
it
appears
to
be
only
an
accidental
straggler
further
east
,
and
it
is
doubtful
if
it
has
ever
occurred
west
of
the
Rocky

.
"
In
Great
Britain
the
Waxwing
has
been
most
frequently
met
with
in
the
northern
and
eastern
counties
;
Mr.
Frohawk
tells
me
that
in
the
winter
of
1867-S
a
flock
of
seven
visited
a
small
plantation
at
Brisley
,
in
Norfolk
;

in

it

from
time
to

in

visited
the
island
and
twenty
were
shot
;
its
visits
to
Scotland
have
been
tolerably
frequent
,
extending
even
to
the
islands
of
Skye
,
Orkney
and
Shetland
,
it
has
twice
been
recorded
from
the
Outer
Hebrides
.
The
upper
surface
of
the
adult
male
Waxwing
is
pale
rosy-brown
,
gradually
changing
to
ash-grey
on
the
rump
and
upper
tail-coverts
,
and
into
chestnut
on
the
sides
of
the
crest
and
forehead
;
a
narrow
frontal
band
,
the
lores
,
and
a
streak
from
the
back
of
the
eye
black
;
wings
and
tail
almost
black
,
the
wing-coverts
,
the
inner
webs
of
the
primaries
,
and
outer
webs
of
the
secondaries
tipped
with
white
,
the
latter
tipped
with
wax-like
vermilion
points
,
the
outside
webs
of
the
primaries
tipped
with
yellow
,
joining
the
white
tij^s
of
the
inner
webs
so
as
to
form
\^-like
markings
;
tail
feathers
broadly
tipped
with
yellow
;
under
surface
rosy-brown
,
shading
into
chestnut
on
the
cheeks
;
a
white
streak
at
the
base
of
the
lower
mandible
;
front
of
throat
and
chin
black
;
centre
of
belly
whitish
;
under
tail-↵coverts
chestnut
;
bill
and
feet
black
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
is
slightly
duller
,
usually
without
the
white
tips
to
the
iuuer
webs
of
the
primaries
,
and
with
smaller
wax-like
terminations
to
the
secondaries
;
the
tips
of
the
tail-feathers
somewhat
narrower
.
The
young
are
browner
,
and
have
no
black
on
the
throat
.
This
species
appears
in
the
breeding-season
to
haunt
the
more
open
portions
of
forests
of
conifers
and
birch
,
but
chiefly
woods
of
pine
,
or
larch
,
nesting
in
colonies
.
The
nest
is
a
large
open
cup-shaped
structure
built
upon
the
branch
of
a
tree
,
upon
a
foundation
of
twigs
and
reindeer
moss
,
composed
principally
of
black
hair-lichen
,
interwoven
with
slender
twigs
,
bark
,
moss
,
and
feathers
,
the
latter
appearing
most
prominently
in
the
lining
.
The
eggs
usually
number
from
five
to
six
,
rarely
seven
,
and
are
described
by
Professor
Newton
,
who
owns
the
greater
part
of
the
large
series
acquired
by
John
Wolley
(
the
discoverer
of
the
breeding-grounds
of
this
species
)
as
"
delicate
sea-green
,
sometimes
fading
to
French
white
,
but
often
of
a
more
or
less
pale-olive
,
and
occasionally
of
a
dull
purplish-↵grey
.
On
this
are
almost
always
bold
blotches
,
spots
,
and
specks
of
deep
brownish-↵black
,
though
sometimes
the
edges
are
blurred
.
Beneath
these
stronger
markings
there
is
nearly
always
a
series
of
blotches
or
streaks
of
greyish-lilac
,
and
among
them
well-defined
spots
or
specks
of
yellowish-brown
are
interspersed
.
In
some
eggs
the
darkest
markings
are
quite
wanting
,
in
others
the
ground
is
of
a
deep
olive
colour
.
"
According
to
Seebohm
,
who
,
in
1867
,
kept
a
pair
of
this
species
in
a
cage
,
"
They
were
remarkably
silent
birds
;
the
only
note
I
heard
was
a
cir-ir-iy-ir-re
,
very
similar
to
a
well-known
note
of
the
Blue-Tit
.
Occasionally
this
succession
of
notes
was
repeated
so
rapidly
as
to
form
a
trill
like
the
song
of
the
Redpole
.
"
In
the
summer
time
the
Waxwing
appears
to
be
largel}'
,
if
not
wholly
insecti-↵vorous
,
crane-flies
seeming
to
constitute
its
favourite
food
;
but
later
in
the
year
it
devours
great
quantities
of
berries
of
juniper
,
privet
,
guelder-rose
,
as
well
as
hips
and
haws
:
it
is
especially
fond
of
mistletoe
berries
.
In
the
winter
,
when
Waxwings
are
very
fat
,
they
are
said
to
be
greatly
esteemed
by
the
Russians
as
an
article
of
food
.
Lord
Lilford
,
in
his
"
Birds
of
Northamptonshire
,
"
speaks
of
"
the
chatter
of
a
party
of
Waxwings
passing
overhead
whilst
we
were
inspecting
my
aviary
in
the
pleasure-grounds
at
Lilford
,
"
and
he
adds
—
"
I
am
well
acquainted
with
the
note
of
the
Waxwing
from
having
kept
many
of
them
in
confinement
,
a
proceeding
which
I
can
not
recommend
,
as
they
have
no
merit
whatever
except
their
beauty
,
being
dull
,
quarrelsome
,
greedy
,
and
filthy
to
an
incredible
degree
,
and
in
most
instances
dying
from
plethora
after
a
short
captivity
.
Hips
and
haws
,
currants
,
raisins
,
(
in
fact
,
small
fruit
of
all
kinds
)
are
voraciously
devoured
by
these
birds
,
and
appear
to
be
their
favourite
food
,
but
they
will
also
eat
chopped
meat
,
hard-↵boiled
egg
,
hemp-seed
,
bread-crumbs
,
carrots
,
potatoes
,
and
ants
'
eggs
;
they
drink
a
great
deal
,
but
seldom
wash
,
and
I
have
more
than
once
seen
a
Waxwing
delib-↵erately
eat
its
own
fseces
,
though
it
was
abundantly
supplied
with
many
varieties
of
food
;
none
of
these
birds
ever
became
tame
with
me
,
and
I
shall
certainly
never
bu}'
au}^
of
them
again
.
"
Seebohm
gives
them
much
the
same
character
:
—
"
They
were
most
voracious
eaters
,
and
the
cage
required
cleaning
several
times
a
day
.
They
were
very
active
and
restless
,
aud
even
when
perched
at
rest
seemed
to
be
continually
moving
their
heads
.
If
alarmed
they
would
stretch
out
their
necks
to
almost
double
the
usual
length
.
"
On
the
other
hand
Swaysland
(
Cassell
's
Cage-birds
,
p.
340
)
says
:
—
"
It
is
easily
tamed
,
and
in
the
aviary
is
docile
and
quiet
.
It
should
be
fed
upon
German
paste
,
sponge-cake
,
a
little
hard-boiled
egg
,
Juniper
berries
,
soaked
grocers
'
currants
,
or
any
other
soft-skinned
fruit
.
"
I
think
it
c|uite
likely
that
,
associated
with
birds
of
its
own
size
in
an
aviarv
,
the
Wa.Kwing
would
become
far
more
easily
reconciled
to
captivit3%
would
eat
less
,
bathe
more
frequently
,
aud
keep
in
better
health
,
than
m
a
cage
:
moreover
,
I
should
certaiul}-
not
recommend
either
raw
meat
or
grocers
'
currants
to
be
given
to
it
as
articles
of
food
.
FAMILY
MUSCICAPID^
.
THIS
large
family
of
birds
was
not
even
regarded
by
Seebohm
as
a
distinct
Subfamil}'
,
but
was
included
by
him
in
the
Turdtna:
;
yet
it
forms
a
very
characteristic
group
:
the
bills
of
Flycatchers
are
somewhat
flattened
and
broad
at
the
base
,
compressed
and
somewhat
curved
towards
the
point
;
the
rictal
bristles
which
,
in
insectivorous
birds
serve
to
prevent
the
escape
of
winged
insects
from
the
base
of
the
bill
,
are
very
strongly
developed
,
and
numerous
in
this
family
.
The
Flycatchers
,
as
their
name
indicates
,
are
rapid
flyers
,
and
consequently
have
long
pointed
wings
;
their
e3'^es
also
are
large
and
full
;
they
perch
mostl}''
on
trees
,
very
rarely
descending
to
the
earth
;
their
feet
,
as
might
be
anticipated
,
are
small
,
the
middle
toe
being
considerably
longer
than
the
lateral
ones
.
The
nests
of
the
Flycatchers
are
open
,
and
more
or
less
cup-shaped
in
character
;
they
are
frequently
placed
in
holes
or
crevices
in
trees
,
rocks
,
or
walls
;
but
some
of
the
species
build
upon
thick
branches
,
or
even
in
the
forks
of
branches
;
the
eggs
of
the
different
species
vary
considerably
in
character
,
some
being
heavily
spotted
,
and
others
spotless
.
*
The
flight
is
undulating
;
the
song
low-pitched
,
and
not
of
great
merit
;
the
food
consists
mainly
of
insects
,
but
is
supplemented
occasionally
by
a
little
fruit
.
Formerly
the
limits
of
this
group
of
birds
were
much
more
extended
than
at
present
;
Jerdon
even
included
the
Blue-throats
,
and
expressed
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
Tyrants
of
the
New
World
belonged
to
the
family
:
vSeebohm
observed
that
—
"
The
Flycatchers
inhabit
the
Palaearctic
,
Oriental
,
and
Ethiopian
regions
,
extending
southwards
to
the
Moluccas
,
but
not
occurring
in
the
Australian
region
.
Four
species
are
found
in
Europe
,
of
which
two
breed
in
the
British
Islands
,
and
one
is
an
accidental
visitor
.
"
The
latter
,
at
the
time
when
his
"
British
Birds
"
appeared
,
had
only
occurred
here
three
times
,
but
of
late
years
other
examples
have
been
obtained
.

The
Spotted
Flycatcher

Muscicapa
grisola
,
LiNN
.
HOWARD
SAUNDERS
states
that
this
species
"
breeds
as
far
north
as
Tromso
,
in
Norway
,
and
Archangel
,
in
Russia
;
while
southward
it
is
tolerably
abundant
throughout
Europe
,
nesting
down
to
the
northern
shores
of
the
Mediterranean
;
also
on
the
African
side
,
and
in
Asia
IMinor
,
Palestine
,
Persia
,
Turkestan
,
and
Siberia
as
far
as
Irkutsk
.
In
winter
it
visits
India
,
Arabia
,
and
Africa
to
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
.
"
In
Great
Britain
the
Spotted
Fljxatcher
breeds
in
suitable
localities
in
everjr
county
,
but
in
England
and
Wales
it
is
far
more
abundant
,
and
more
generally
distributed
than
in
Scotland
and
Ireland
:
its
distribution
in
the
latter
island
is
certainly
local
,
and
it
is
probable
that
some
counties
are
unsuited
to
its
requirements
.
The
colouring
of
this
bird
is
decidedly
sombre
,
its
upper
surface
being
brown
,
slightl}'
paler
and
with
dark
shaft-streaks
on
the
crown
;
the
wings
and
tail
darker
brown
,
with
paler
margins
to
the
wing-coverts
and
secondaries
:
its
under
surface
is
gre3'ish
-
wliite
;
the
breast
and
flanks
slightly
buff-brownish
,
and
streaked
with
brown
,
as
also
is
the
throat
;
bill
dark
brown
;
feet
black
;
iris
dark
hazel
.
The
female
greatly
resembles
the
male
,
but
is
somewhat
browner
and
is
more
heavily
streaked
on
the
underparts
.
The
j-oung
have
buff
centres
to
the
feathers
of
the
upper
surface
,
whilst
the
wing-coverts
,
secondaries
,
and
tail-coverts
are
tipped
with
this
colour
.
The
Spotted
Flj'catcher
haunts
the
out.skirts
of
woods
,
high
hedges
on
the
borders
of
parks
and
pleasure
grounds
,
plantations
of
hazel
,
orchards
,
and
gardens
,
and
in
siich
places
it
breeds
,
usuall}-
placing
its
nest
either
in
a
slight
depression
in
the
branch
of
a
tree
,
frequently
near
the
trunk
,
or
on
the
branch
of
a
fruit-tree
trained
against
a
wall
;
it
has
,
however
,
been
known
to
build
in
crevices
of
the
bark
of
old
trees
,
in
trellis-work
overgrown
with
creepers
,
and
I
have
taken
the
nest
from
the
hollow
top
of
a
tree
stump
,
from
a
tall
hawthorn
hedge
,
aud
one
in
ni}'
collection
was
taken
from
a
narrow
hole
in
a
wall
.
*
The
form
of
the
nest
varies
in
accordance
with
its
surroundings
;
if
placed
upon
a
branch
or
in
the
top
of
a
hedge
it
is
circular
,
if
on
a
fruit-branch
trained
against
a
wall
,
semicircular
,
aud
the
nest
which
I
obtained
from
a
hole
in
a
wall
was
of
the
exact
shape
of
a
small
slipper
;
the
materials
of
the
nest
also
var}'
somewhat
,
but
they
generally
consist
of
twigs
and
roots
,
or
fine
grasses
,
mixed
with
a
quantity
of
green
moss
interwoven
with
spiders
'
webs
,
and
lined
with
fine
grass
,
hair
,
and
sometimes
two
or
three
feathers
.
The
eggs
vary
in
number
from
three
to
six
,
five
being
the
most
usual
number
,
the
ground
colour
being
frequently
pale
pea-green
,
but
sometimes
bluish-↵white
,
blotched
,
zoned
,
mottled
or
spotted
with
various
depths
of
ferruginous
red-↵brown
;
when
the
mottling
is
very
dense
the
egg
,
excepting
in
its
inferior
size
and
narrower
shape
,
somewhat
reminds
one
of
that
of
the
Robin
,
and
when
the
markings
are
chiefly
represented
by
a
zone
near
the
larger
end
,
it
vaguely
suggests
that
of
the
Greenfinch
.
The
Spotted
Flycatctier
rarely
reaches
us
before
May
;
but
,
nevertheless
is
in
no
hurry
to
go
to
nest
;
the
earliest
date
at
which
I
have
taken
its
eggs
was
on
the
30th
of
that
month
,
and
they
are
rarely
obtained
before
June
.
As
proof
that
birds
are
sometimes
unable
to
recognize
their
own
eggs
,
the
following
fact
(
already
recorded
in
my
Handbook
of
British
Oology
)
is
of
interest
:
On
the
4th
June
,
1S78
,
I
removed
three
eggs
from
a
rather
small
nest
of
the
Spotted
Flycatcher
formed
in
the
hollow
top
of
a
tree
stump
in
a
small
plantation
of
hazels
.
I
substituted
three
hazel-nuts
for
the
eggs
,
and
these
completely
filled
the
cavity
of
the
nest
.
On
the
8th
of
June
I
returned
and
found
the
hen
sitting
:
she
had
ejected
one
of
the
hazel-nuts
to
make
room
for
a
fourth
egg
-
Respecting
the
notes
of
this
species
,
Seebohm
sa3'S
:
—
"
It
is
very
widely
and
popularly
believed
that
the
Spotted
Flycatcher
is
not
gifted
with
any
powers
of
song
;
but
this
is
an
error
.
His
song
is
heard
but
rarely
,
it
is
true
,
and
is
uttered
in
such
a
low
tone
as
to
be
scarcely
heard
a
few
yards
awa}'
.
It
is
given
forth
both
when
the
bird
is
sitting
at
rest
and
when
fluttering
in
the
air
after
insects
.
It
consists
of
a
few
rambling
notes
,
not
unlike
part
of
the
Whinchat
's
song
.
The
monotonous
call-note
may
perhaps
be
best
expressed
by
the
letters
cf
,
zt
;
it
is
uttered
in
rapid
succession
from
one
perching-place
,
and
every
now
and
then
the
tail
is
jerked
to
and
fro
with
graceful
motion
.
Sometimes
a
second
syllable
is
added
to
the
call-note
,
which
then
sounds
like
zt-chick
.
'
"
I
think
that
Seebohm
is
incorrect
in
this
last
statement
:
in
1894
I
had
a
family
of
young
Spotted
Flycatchers
in
my
garden
for
over
a
week
,
and
I
found
that
their
call
to
their
parents
was
zt-chick
,
and
the
answer
of
the
parents
was
sf
.
I
never
heard
an
adult
bird
use
the
longer
call
.
The
food
of
the
Spotted
Flycatcher
in
the
summer
months
consists
of
insects
,
spiders
,
and
centipedes
,
but
in
the
autumn
it
is
said
to
eat
the
berries
of
the
mountain-ash
;
much
of
its
food
is
obtained
on
the
wing
,
either
by
repeated
sallies
into
the
air
,
by
hawking
low
down
over
the
meadows
,
or
hovering
in
front
of
old
walls
,
or
manure
heaps
.
As
this
species
rarely
has
eggs
before
the
beginning
of
June
,
and
usually
leaves
this
country
in
September
,
it
is
not
surprising
that
it
is
single
brooded
.
Mr.
Gumey
's
experience
of
the
perseverance
with
which
this
species
adheres
to
a
building
site
was
published
many
years
since
in
the
"
Zoologist
"
;
but
never-↵theless
is
sufficiently
interesting
to
bear
repeating
here
;
he
says
:
—
"
About
the
end
of
June
last
,
a
Spotted
Flycatcher
began
to
build
a
nest
over
the
door
of
the
lodge
at
the
entrance
of
my
grounds
.
The
woman
who
lives
in
the
lodge
,
not
wishing
the
bird
to
build
there
,
destro3'ed
the
commencement
of
the
nest
;
every
day
for
a
week
the
bird
placed
new
materials
on
the
same
ledge
over
the
door
,
and
every
day
the
woman
removed
them
,
and
,
at
the
end
of
the
week
,
placed
a
stone
on
the
ledge
,
which
effectuallv
baffled
the
Flycatcher
's
efforts
at
that
spot
;
but
the
bird
then
began
building
at
the
latter
end
of
the
ledge
,
from
whence
it
was
also
driven
,
and
three
stones
being
then
placed
on
the
ledge
,
the
bird
relin-↵quished
the
attempt
to
build
at
either
end
of
it
,
and
commenced
building
a
nest
on
a
beech-tree
opposite
,
which
it
completed
,
and
laid
two
eggs
in
it
.
When
the
bird
was
thus
apparently
established
in
the
beech-tree
,
the
stones
over
the
door
were
taken
away
,
when
the
Flycatcher
immediately
forsook
its
nest
and
eggs
in
the
beech
,
and
again
commenced
building
over
the
door
on
the
part
of
the
pro-↵jecting
ledge
,
which
it
had
first
chosen
.
The
nest
was
again
destro3^ed
,
and
two
slates
placed
over
the
spot
;
the
bird
contrived
to
throw
down
one
of
the
slates
from
a
slanting
to
a
horizontal
position
,
and
then
began
to
build
upon
it
.
The
nest
\\'a.s
again
destro3'ed
,
and
the
three
stones
replaced
and
kept
there
a
fortnight
,
after
which
they
were
again
removed
,
and
,
directly
they
were
taken
awa}-
,
the
bird
again
began
building
.
The
nest
was
subsequently
destro3-ed
several
times
in
succession
;
the
bird
was
twice
driven
awa}'
b}^
a
towel
being
thrown
at
it
;
a
stone
wrapped
in
white
paper
was
placed
on
the
ledge
to
intimidate
it
,
but
the
Fl3'catcher
still
persevered
,
completed
a
nest
,
and
laid
an
egg
-
On
hearing
the
circumstances
I
directed
that
the
perseciition
of
the
poor
bird
shoiild
cease
,
after
which
it
laid
two
more
eggs
,
hatched
all
three
,
and
successfull3'
brought
off
its
brood
.
"
Some
3'ears
since
a
3'oung
Spotted
Fl3
-
catcher
was
brought
to
me
;
it
had
flown
against
a
lan:p
,
was
temporaril3^
stunned
,
and
a
lad
picked
it
up
without
difficulty
.
I
tried
to
keep
it
,
but
it
refused
to
feed
,
as
most
birds
do
after
the3'
have
left
the
nest
,
and
,
although
I
forced
it
to
eat
,
it
died
the
next
day
:
perhaps
I
lost
nothing
b3'
the
death
of
this
bird
;
for
the
Flycatchers
are
not
especially
suited
to
cage
or
aviar3'
life
,
are
neither
attractive
in
plumage
or
song
,
and
are
said
to
be
delicate
and
difficult
to
keep
in
health
.
If
reared
from
the
nest
they
would
doubtless
eat
the
usual
soft
food
,
but
I
should
expect
them
to
follow
the
example
of
the
Hirundinidce
,
eat
to
repletion
and
take
little
exercise
.
They
have
been
kept
,
but
it
may
be
questioned
whether
it
is
worth
the
trouble
.

RESPECTING
the
distribution
of
this
species
outside
Great
Britain
,
one
can
not
do
better
than
quote
Howard
Saunders
:
—
"
A
wanderer
to
the
Faroes
,
the
Pied
Fl3'catcher
breeds
regularly
up
to
69°
N.
lat
.
in
Scan-↵dinavia
,
65°
in
Finland
,
and
about
60°
in
Northern
Russia
to
the
Ural
Mountains
;
southward
,
in
suitable
wooded
localities
,
throughout
the
greater
part
of
Europe
,
down
to
the
centre
of
Spain
;
and
eastward
as
far
as
Palestine
;
while
it
has
been
met
with
in
Northern
Persia
.
In
Algeria
it
is
said
to
be
a
resident
species
,
its
migrations
extending
to
the
Canaries
,
and
down
the
west
side
of
Africa
to
the
Gambia
,
as
well
as
on
the
east
side
to
Egypt
.
In
Great
Britain
this
species
is
far
rarer
,
and
much
more
local
than
the
Spotted
Flycatcher
,
but
especially
during
the
breeding
season
:
although
nests
have
from
time
to
time
been
obtained
in
many
of
the
southern
counties
of
England
,
it
principally
affects
the
western
counties
,
Wales
,
and
the
north
,
but
more
partic-↵ularly
the
Lake
district
;
it
is
said
to
occur
annually
in
Norfolk
,
and
has
occurred
in
Rutland
and
Lincolnshire
.
In
Scotland
,
and
especially
in
the
northern
counties
,
it
is
considerably
rarer
than
in
England
,
and
in
Ireland
it
has
been
very
seldom
met
with
.
The
adult
male
in
breeding-plumage
has
the
upper
parts
black
,
greyer
on
the
rump
,
and
browner
on
the
wings
;
the
forehead
,
central
coverts
,
outer
borders
of
secondaries
,
and
under
parts
white
;
bill
and
feet
black
;
iris
dark
brown
.
The
female
differs
from
the
male
in
the
browner
colouring
of
the
upper
parts
,
and
all
the
white
areas
with
a
huffish
stain
.
The
male
after
its
autumn
moult
more
nearly
approaches
the
female
,
inasmuch
as
the
black
colouring
becomes
brownish
.
Young
in
nestling
plumage
have
the
upper
parts
spotted
with
buff
,
and
the
under
parts
with
dark-brown
.
The
Pied
Flycatcher
arrives
on
our
coasts
towards
the
end
of
April
,
and
the
first
eggs
may
usually
be
obtained
by
about
the
middle
of
the
following
month
,
although
some
pairs
nidificate
several
weeks
later
.
Unlike
its
relative
the
Spotted
Flycatcher
,
it
always
nests
in
a
hole
,
either
in
a
tree
,
a
rock
,
wall
,
or
bridge
,
(
especially
when
built
over
water
)
;
deserted
nesting-holes
of
Woodpeckers
or
Tits
are
sometimes
utilized
:
it
haunts
groves
of
oak
,
beech
,
aspen
,
or
chestnut
,
in
preference
to
dense
wood
;
although
,
according
to
Dixon
,
it
may
sometimes
be
met
with
in
the
latter
situation
.
Lord
Lilford
saj's
that
"
the
nest
is
generally
situated
in
the
hole
of
a
pollard
willow
,
or
other
tree
,
often
in
an
old
wall
;
in
fact
,
very
much
in
the
sort
of
locality
that
we
should
look
for
a
nest
of
the
Common
Red-↵start
.
"
The
nest
is
somewhat
loosely
constructed
of
dry
bents
,
rootlets
,
and
a
little
moss
;
the
lining
being
formed
of
wool
,
feathers
,
and
sometimes
hair
.
The
eggs
vary
in
number
from
four
to
eight
,
five
to
six
being
usual
.
As
Lord
Lilford
observes
"
Yarrell
records
an
instance
of
eight
in
a
nest
,
but
,
from
my
acquaintance
with
this
species
in
Spain
,
I
should
consider
that
number
as
very
exceptional
.
"
The
colouring
is
always
a
ver}'
pale
blue
and
unspotted
,
there
is
a
slight
variation
in
depth
of
tint
,
but
otherwise
the
only
modifications
in
the
eggs
of
this
bird
are
in
size
and
outline
,
depending
much
upon
the
age
and
condition
of
health
of
the
parent
bird
.
W.
Warde
Fowler
in
his
charming
"
Summer
Studies
of
Birds
and
Books
,
"
gives
a
most
delightful
account
of
the
Pied
Fl3'catcher
,
which
is
well
worth
quoting
in
full
,
if
only
space
would
permit
;
but
I
must
content
myself
with
an
extract
:
—
"
On
the
Continent
I
have
always
seen
him
in
just
such
places
as
he
loves
in
Wales
,
among
the
larger
timber
of
a
Swiss
mountain-side
,
or
on
the
forest
slopes
of
the
Taunus
range
.
Just
as
the
trout
loves
swiftly-running
streams
,
or
as
the
Wood-wren
is
sure
to
be
heard
where
the
oak
is
the
prevailing
tree
,
so
there
are
certain
spots
which
you
instinctivel}'
feel
that
this
bird
ought
to
have
chosen
for
his
habitation
,
and
if
you
are
in
the
right
district
you
may
fairly
lay
a
wager
that
he
will
be
found
there
.
Such
a
spot
,
on
the
edge
of
the
beech
forests
of
Wiesbaden
,
will
always
remain
in
very
clear
outline
in
my
memory
,
for
it
was
there
I
first
heard
the
song
of
this
bird
.
It
is
very
seldom
now
that
I
hear
a
song
that
is
quite
new
to
me
.
If
it
were
not
that
so
many
of
our
songsters
sing
all
too
short
a
time
,
and
that
when
they
tune
up
one
by
one
for
the
orchestra
of
the
spring
season
each
instrument
touches
the
ear
with
the
fresh
delight
of
recog-↵nition
,
I
might
feel
as
much
at
the
end
of
my
tether
as
the
mountaineer
who
has
no
more
peaks
to
climb
.
But
this
song
was
not
only
new
,
but
wonderfully
sweet
and
striking
.
'
Something
like
a
Redstart
's
'
say
the
books
,
and
this
is
not
untrue
,
so
far
as
it
represents
the
outward
form
,
so
to
speak
,
of
the
song
—
the
quickness
or
shortness
of
notes
,
the
rapid
variations
of
pitch
.
But
no
one
who
has
once
accustomed
his
ear
to
the
very
peculiar
tijubre
of
the
voice
of
either
kind
of
Red-↵start
will
mistake
for
it
the
song
of
the
Pied
Flycatcher
.
My
notes
,
taken
on
the
spot
,
and
before
I
had
seen
any
other
description
of
it
,
recall
the
song
to
my
memory
—
the
short
notes
at
the
beginning
,
the
rather
fragmentary
and
hesitating
character
of
the
strain
,
and
the
little
coda
or
iiuish
,
which
reminded
me
of
the
Chaffinch
,
but
all
this
will
have
no
meaning
to
nij^
readers
.
There
is
but
one
way
of
learning
a
bird
's
song
,
and
that
is
by
listening
to
it
in
solitude
again
and
again
,
until
you
have
associated
it
in
your
mind
,
with
the
form
,
and
habits
,
and
haunts
of
the
singer
.
"
Gatke
states
that
the
Pied
Flycatcher
"
visits
Heligoland
in
larger
numbers
than
any
of
its
near
relatives
.
It
is
especially
abundant
during
the
autumn
migration
,
returning
from
its
nesting
quarters
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
August
,
if
the
weather
is
fine
and
warm
,
and
the
wind
from
the
south
or
south-east
.
"
"
Why
this
bird
should
migrate
before
scarcity
of
food
or
cold
compel
it
to
do
so
,
it
is
difficult
to
imderstand
;
probably
the
tendency
has
been
inherited
,
and
points
back
to
some
remote
period
when
the
summers
of
Kurope
were
of
short
duration
.
The
food
of
this
species
consists
largely
of
insects
,
but
it
rarely
,
if
ever
,
pursues
them
in
the
air
like
the
Spotted
Flycatcher
,
preferring
to
watch
from
the
end
of
a
branch
,
and
pounce
suddenly
down
upon
them
;
it
is
not
,
therefore
,
sur-↵prising
that
among
the
pellets
of
undigested
matter
ejected
by
this
,
as
by
other
insectivorous
birds
,
wing-cases
of
small
beetles
predominate
;
it
is
,
however
,
said
to
pick
flies
and
gnats
from
leaves
upon
which
they
have
settled
,
and
to
eat
worms
.
Later
in
the
year
,
as
currants
,
raspberries
,
elderberries
,
etc.
,
become
ripe
,
the
Pied
Flycatcher
is
said
to
add
them
to
its
dietary
.
Far
more
beautiful
than
its
Spotted
relative
,
and
with
a
much
better
idea
of
music
,
it
is
no
wonder
that
,
where
opportunity
offers
,
this
species
is
prized
as
a
cage-bird
;
yet
I
have
never
seen
one
exhibited
in
England
;
though
in
Germany
the
Pied
Flycatcher
has
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
exhibitions
of
the
"
Ornis
"
Society
.
Being
so
much
more
local
in
Great
Britain
than
the
Spotted
Flycatcher
,
this
species
is
much
less
frequently
obtained
at
the
right
age
for
hand-rearing
:
when
once
obtained
,
however
,
Swaysland
assures
us
that
it
is
far
more
easy
to
keep
than
the
commoner
species
,
and
may
be
turned
either
into
cage
or
aviary
,
and
fed
in
the
same
w'Siy
as
Warblers
,
or
as
the
Nightingale
.
Doubtless
the
food
recommended
for
M.
grisola
by
Mr.
Louis
Bonhote
(
Avicultural
Magazine
,
Vol
.
I
,
p.
58
)
would
answer
equally
well
for
this
species
;
he
says
:
—
"
In
captivity
,
they
should
be
fed
on
ants
'
eggs
,
and
hard-boiled
eggs
,
mixed
in
equal
parts
,
and
as
many
mealworms
as
their
keeper
can
afford
to
give
them
.
They
become
very
tame
,
and
will
rise
in
the
air
and
catch
mealworms
as
they
are
thrown
to
them
.
In
catching
a
mealworm
,
they
leave
the
perch
and
hover
in
the
air
,
waiting
for
the
mealworm
to
drop
,
and
catch
it
as
it
passes
them
;
if
they
should
miss
it
,
they
follow
it
closely
and
catch
it
as
soou
as
it
reaches
the
ground
.
"
The

Fly-↵catcher
would
probably
do
the
latter
every
time

WITH
respect
to
the
distribution
of
this
species
,
Seebohm
informs
us
that
it
"
breeds
in
Germany
,
Austria
,
and
South
Russia
as
far
north
as
the
Baltic
Provinces
,
arriving
during
the
latter
end
of
April
,
or
early
in
Ma3%
and
departing
again
in
August
or
September
.
Its
occurrence
in
Western
Europe
is
only
accidental
.
"
"
Loche
,
says
that
it
is
found
in
Algeria
,
where
it
may
be
a
rare
winter
visitor
.
It
passes
through
Trans3dvania
,
Turkey
,
Greece
,
and
Asia
Minor
on
migration
,
and
winters
in
Nubia
.
"
"
It
breeds
in
the
Caucasus
,
and
winters
in
Persia
.
"
His
further
remarks
tend
to
show
that
it
passes
through
Turkestan
on
migration
,
occurs
in
the
Baikal
district
,
has
been
obtained
in
Kam-↵schatka
,
and
winters
in

India
and
South
China

the
same
day
of
the
month
as
the
Irish
example
in
1887
.
Since
that
date
one
was
shot
at
Wells
in
1900
;
a
specimen
is
recorded
for
1904
,
a
third
for
1905
,
three
for
1906
,
all
from
Norfolk
;
three
were
seen
in
Yorkshire
in
1907
;
in
Cheshire
one
was
seen
in
June
1903
;
in
the
Shetlands
several
were
seen
and
three
shot
in
1906
.
It
would
therefore
appear
that
this
little
Flycatcher
is
likely
to
occur
,
especially
late
in
the
autumn
,
upon
our
coasts
;
and
,
inasmuch
as
one
example
on
an
average
has
lost
its
life
,
in
addition
to
those
seen
,
every
two
years
(
taking
the
dates
from
1863
to
1907
)
,
the
importance
of
admitting
the
species
into
the
present
work
will
be
recognized
.
This
elegant
little
species
has
a
curious
resemblance
to
our
Robin
,
and
Seebohm
expresses
the
opinion
that
it
is
"
a
connecting-link
between
the
Robins
and
the
Flycatchers
"
;
his
description
of
the
bird
is
so
satisfactory
that
,
in
the
present
instance
,
I
shall
quote
it
iu
full
:
—
'
"
The
Red-breasted
Flycatcher
has
the
general
colour
of
the
upper
parts
,
except
the
crown
,
nape
,
and
sides
of
the
head
and
neck
which
are
bluish-grey
,
olive-brown
;
central
tail-feathers
blackish-brown
;
the
outer
ones
white
at
base
,
and
broadly
tipped
with
blackish-brown
;
throat
and
breast
orange-chestnut
;
rest
of
underparts
white
,
suffused
on
the
flanks
and
under
tail-↵coverts
with
buff
;
beak
brown
,
paler
at
the
base
;
irides
hazel
;
legs
,
toes
,
and
claws
dark
brown
.
The
female
in
general
colouration
resembles
the
male
,
except
that
the
rich
orange-chestnut
throat
is
replaced
by
buff
,
and
the
bluish-grey
is
wanting
on
the
head
and
sides
of
the
neck
.
Males
of
the
j'ear
scarcely
differ
from
the
female
,
and
breed
in
the
following
spring
in
immature
plumage
(
M.
mituita
)
.
In
the
second
year
the
chestnut
appears
on
the
throat
(
M.
leucura
)
;
in
the
third
year
the
chestnut
appears
on
the
upper
breast
(
M.
parva
)
;
and
in
the
fourth
year
it
extends
also
on
to
the
lower
breast
"
{
M.
hyperythra
)
.
"
Young
in
first
plumage
are
spotted
on
the
breast
and
upper
parts
,
as
in
all
the
allied
species
.
"
I
believe
that
this
is
by
no
means
the
only
species
which
has
received
a
different
name
for
each
plumage
:
I
have
already
noted
*
that
examples
of
Munia
atricapilla
which
I
received
in
young
plumage
in
1887
,
did
not
acquire
the
distinc-↵tive
black
ventral
band
until
the
second
moult
;
but
a
more
curious
change
occurred
in
the
spring
of
1896
,
when
one
of
my
old
examples
of
Quelea
quelea
assumed
the
breeding-plumage
of
Q.
ri<sst
,
the
black
mask
being
wholly
lost
,
and
I
have
since
proved
that
the
little
Cardinal
(
Paroaria
ccrvicalis
)
is
only
an
incomplete
plumage
of
P.
capiiata
.
This
species
appears
to
be
more
essentially
a
forest-haunting
bird
than
our
other
Flycatchers
,
breediug
iu
beech-woods
,
aud
only
visiting
gardens
in
their
vicinity
.
The
song
is
said
by
Seebohm
to
be
very
nnobtrnsive
and
intermediate
between
those
of
the
Robin
aud
Redstart
,
and
he
describes
the
alarm-note
as
piuk
,
p'nik
,
pink
,
something
like
the
spi)ik
of
a
Chaffinch
;
probably
Naumann
's
call-note
of
this
species
is
the
same
sound
,
and
he
expresses
it
''
fnid
,
fiiidr
I
,
therefore
,
have
no
doubt
that
the
true
rendering
of
the
note
would
be
''
plnvick
"'
or
''
phivW
;
for
no
Chaffinch
ever
had
a
note
the
least
bit
like
spink
or
puik
,
aud
/
,
not
d
,
is
one
of
the
terminal
sounds
in
bird-notes
:
Dr.
A.
Walter
,
according
to
Giitke
,
describes
the
call
as
a
rattling
sound
,
but
doubtless
the
latter
would
be
a
scolding
note
.
In
its
actions
the
Red-breasted
Flycatcher
resembles
our
other
species
,
some-↵times
it
pursues
its
prey
in
the
air
,
but
sometimes
it
picks
them
from
the
trunk
of
a
tree
:
in
addition
to
insects
it
also
eats
small
fruits
.
The
nest
is
usually
placed
in
a
beech-tree
,
either
in
a
cavity
,
in
trunk
,
or
branch
,
or
against
the
trunk
,
supported
by
outgrowing
twigs
;
in
form
it
is
a
somewhat
deep
cup
,
formed
of
moss
,
a
few
fragments
of
lichen
,
and
a
few
soft
feathers
;
the
lining
of
fine
bents
and
hairs
.
The
number
of
the
eggs
varies
from
five
to
seven
,
bluish-green
,
more
or
less
mottled
or
speckled
with
rusty-brown
,
sometime
so
densely
as
almost
to
conceal
the
ground-colour
,
and
with
greyish-brown
shell-markings
:
in
character
they
are
intermediate
between
those
of
the
Spotted
Flycatcher
and
the
Robin
.
This
bird
is
said
to
be
almost
as
pugnacious
as
a
Robin
;
therefore
it
would
be
well
to
use
caution
in
associating
it
with
other
species
iu
an
aviary
.
As
a
cage-bird
it
has
been
both
kept
and
exhibited
in
Germany
,
and
if
reared
from
the
nest
would
doubtless
be
very
tame
and
make
a
most
attractive
pet
,
feeding
readily
on
the
usual
soft
food
;
Seebohm
,
however
,
states
that
"
birds
of
this
species
in
confinement
feed
upon
the
common
house-fly
with
great
avidity
,
preferring
it
to
any
artificial
food
.
"
Doubtless
this
statement
is
correct
,
but
it
would
be
quite
out
of
the
question
to
attempt
to
feed
this
,
or
any
other
bird
upon
flies
alone
.
FAMILY
HIRUNDINID^
.
SEEBOHAI
widely
dissevers
the
Swallows
from
the
Flycatchers
,
placing
them
immediately
after
the
Bunting
's
;
possibly
because
of
the
fact
that
the
tenth
primary
is
small
and
concealed
b}-
the
upper
covert
,
but
is
not
absent
as
Seebohm
states
.
He
says
that
they
"
are
distinguished
by
their
long
pointed
wings
,
slender
,
wide
bills
,
and
small
legs
and
feet
.
The
*
*
*
*
ninth
primary
is
generally
the
longest
.
The
tarsus
is
scutellated
in
front
,
and
the
tail
is
generally
forked
.
The
most
marked
feature
in
the
Swallows
is
that
they
have
no
autumn
moult
,
their
new
dress
being
assumed
in
February
.
"
The
broad
bill
,
small
feet
,
and
long
pointed
wings
of
the
Swallows
,
appear
to
me
to
show
some
affinity
to
the
Flycatchers
;
whilst
I
find
that
H^michclidon
fuli-↵giiiosus
,
which
Jerdon
placed
among
the
most
typical
Flycatchers
of
India
,
is
said
to
have
"
very
much
the
aspect
of
a
Swallow
,
both
in
colour
and
structure
"
(

.
That
certainly
seems
a
hardly
natural
classification
,
which
interposes
the
whole
of
the
Crows
,
Waxwings
,
Starlings
,
and
Finches
,
between
two
groups
of
birds
so
similar
in
their
methods
of
feeding
,
and
so
eminently
fitted
for
an
aerial
existence
as
the
Flycatchers
and
Swallows
.
The
Hirujidinida:
constitute
a
large
,
interesting
,
and
widely
distributed
family
of
very
beautiful
birds
;
their
nests
,
familiar
to
everyone
,
are
triumphs
of
skill
and
perseverance
;
and
,
as
regards
our
three
British
species
,
show
good
distinctive
features
.
Although
it
would
hardly
be
supposed
that
Swallows
were
suitable
subjects
for
aviculture
;
attempts
have
been
made
,
with
varying
success
,
to
keep
the
whole
of
our
three
species
:
but
,
to
preserve
the
health
of
such
active
birds
,
a
great
deal
of
exercise
is
a
necessity
,
and
a
very
large
aviary
a
consequent
requisite
:
as
cage-↵birds
,
Swallows
frequently
quickly
succumb
to
indigestion
from
over-feeding
,
and
lack
of
exercise
.

The
Swallow
.
Ilinoido
yu\tica
,
LiNN
.
THE
Swallow
breeds
throughout
the
greater
part
of
Europe
,
Asia
,
north
of
the
great
luountaiu
rauges
,
and
Northern
Africa
:
in
winter
it
has
been
obtained
all
over
India
,
to
Burma
and
Malaysia
,
and
throughout
Africa
:
exceptional
cases
of
its
occurrence
in
East
Finmark
,
vSpitzbergeu
,
and
Nova
Zembla
have
been
recorded
.
Throughout
Great
Britain
the
Swallow
is
generally
distributed
,
although
it
is
said
rarely
to
breed
in
Shetland
,
and
never
in
the
Outer
Hebrides
.
According
to
Capt
.
Feilden
it
is
common
in
the
Faroes
,
in
Ma}^
but
is
not
known
to
nest
there
.
At
the
season
of
migration
the
Swallow
collects
into
flocks
,
and
}ilr
.
Fro-↵liawk
,
in
September
(
about
the
28th
or
30th
)
,
counted
113
sitting
on
one
stretch
of
telegraph
wire
at
Buckland
,
in
South
Devon
.
In
adult
plumage
this
species
has
the
forehead
chestnut
,
upper
parts
prussian-↵blue
,
wings
and
tail
brown
,
with
the
outer
webs
of
the
feathers
bluish-green
;
the
inner
web
of
the
innermost
greater
wing-covert
greyish- white
;
all
the
tail-feathers
excepting
the
central
pair
,
with
white
patches
on
the
inner
webs
:
under
parts
almost
white
,
the
throat
chestnut
;
a
belt
of
prussian-blue
across
the
breast
;
under
wing-coverts
and
belly
huffish
;
bill
and
feet
black
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
chiefly
differs
from
the
male
in
the
shorter
tapering
outer
tail
feathers
,
somewhat
duller
colouring
,
whiter
under
parts
,
and
narrower
breast-belt
.
Young
birds
are
duller
,
with
the
chestnut
portions
paler
,
and
the
spots
on
the
tail
somewhat
rufous
.
It
is
believed
that
the
Swallow
pairs
for
life
,
and
it
is
certain
that
it
returns
year
after
year
to
the
same
breeding
spot
,
sometimes
even
utilizing
the
previous
year
's
nest
;
it
is
naturally
a
gregarious
bird
;
though
perhaps
not
so
much
so
as
the
House-
and
Sand-Martins
;
where
one
nest
occurs
,
in
chimney
,
barn
,
or
out-↵house
,
there
are
sure
to
be
three
or
four
close
b}^
but
I
never
observed
more
than
half
a
dozen
or
so
,
even
in
the
largest
barn
,
whereas
it
is
not
unusual
to
see
eight
or
ten
nests
of
the
House-Martin
under
the
eaves
of
a
house
,
whilst
the
occupied
burrows
of
Sand-Martins
in
a
single
sand-bank
frequently
number
from
twenty
to
thirty
.
The
favourite
haunts
of
the
Swallow
are
country
villages
,
hamlets
,
or
even
isolated
houses
,
and
cottages
;
but
it
rarely
penetrates
far
into
the
larger
towns
.
It
places
its
nest
in
various
situations-
—
on
joists
of
barns
,
out-houses
,
boat-houses
,
in
which
case
the
form
of
the
nest
varies
from
an
oval
to
a
half-
,
or
quarter-cup
;
against
perpendicular
walls
under
eaves
of
barns
*
;
inside
chimne3's
,
wells
,
and
mines
;
in
corners
of
pillared
porticoes
to
large
houses
;
under
rustic
bridges
;
cases
have
even
been
recorded
of
nests
built
in
a
hole
in
a
tree
about
thirty
feet
from
the
ground
,
and
in
the
forking
branch
of
a
s3'camore
.
In
its
wild
state
in
mountainous
or
rocky
localities
this
bird
naturally
builds
against
the
sides
of
cliffs
under
overhanging
ledges
of
rock
,
or
in
caves
;
but
in
Great
Britain
it
usually
seeks
the
habitations
of
men
for
nesting-sites
.
The
nest
is
always
open
above
;
the
walls
thick
,
and
formed
of
mud-pellets
mixed
with
straw
,
ha}'
,
or
hair
;
the
lining
consists
of
fine
grass-stems
,
usually
almost
concealed
b}'
a
quantity
of
feathers
,
though
in
some
instances
these
are
absent
.
As
is
usually
the
case
with
nests
more
or
less
exposed
to
light
from
above
,
the
eggs
are
not
wholly
white
and
immaculate
,
the
ground-colour
is
pure
white
,
appearing
rosy
when
not
incubated
;
speckled
,
spotted
,
and
occasionally
heavily
blotched
with
deep
pitchy
brown
,
often
intermixed
with
sienna
reddish
spots
,
and
with
lavender-grey
shell-spots
;
in
some
eggs
the
spots
are
small
and
tolerably
evenly
distributed
over
the
entire
surface
,
sometimes
they
are
larger
,
and
principally
collected
at
the
larger
end
;
sometimes
there
is
an
imperfect
zone
of
spots
,
and
even
large
blotches
near
the
larger
end
:
some
eggs
are
elongated
ovals
,
others
short
and
well-formed
.
The
Swallow
when
approaching
its
nest
always
utters
a
plaintive
warning
note
,
the
intention
of
which
doubtless
is
,
to
call
the
attention
of
its
3'oung
to
its
advent
;
but
this
call
is
uttered
even
before
the
eggs
are
deposited
,
and
is
continued
after
the
nest
has
been
robbed
:
this
has
given
the
impression
to
unobservant
persons
that
the
parents
mourn
over
the
loss
of
their
possessions
.
Seebohm
asserts
that
the
Swallow
builds
a
fresh
nest
every
j^ear
;
but
I
have
proved
conclusively
that
,
when
built
under
the
shelter
of
a
portico
,
where
it
is
protected
from
wet
,
the
same
nest
is
sometimes
used
for
three
consecutive
years
;
indeed
I
have
in
my
collection
a
nest
with
the
clutches
of
eggs
which
it
contained
in
June
1881
and
1883
:
in
1882
I
was
forbidden
to
touch
the
eggs
because
the
lady
of
the
house
said
"
the
poor
birds
cried
every
time
they
approached
the
nest
"
t
after
I
had
taken
the
first
chitch
:
these
eggs
are
more
heavily
marked
than
any
which
I
have
obtained
elsewhere
.
The
Swallow
is
an
admirable
singer
,
and
I
shall
not
easily
forget
the
pleasure
with
which
I
first
heard
it
,
as
it
poured
forth
its
sweet
melod}'
from
the
girders
of
a
large
railway-station
in
Switzerland
,
in
1869
;
I
have
heard
it
several
times
since
,
both
in
Kent
and
Norfolk
,
singing
from
a
telegraph
wire
:
the
song
is
ver}'
varied
and
,
to
my
mind
,
far
more
melodious
than
that
of
a
Linnet
.
Its
call
may
be
heard
as
it
chases
its
insect
prey
—
hvi/
,
hivit
,
or
as
it
greets
a
passing
comrade
,
lnvit
(it
-
tit
-
(il
.
The
food
of
the
Swallow
consists
largel}'
of
gnats
,
small
flies
,
and
ephemerae
;
but
it
frequently
settles
on
the
roads
,
or
on
manure
heaps
,
to
search
for
small
dung-beetles
:
owing
to
its
short
legs
,
its
progression
on
the
earth
is
somewhat
awkward
,
and
when
hurried
it
uses
its
wings
to
help
it
along
:
it
usually
drinks
on
the
wing
,
skimming
the
surface
of
the
water
as
it
glides
over
:
its
rapid
graceful
flight
is
too
well
known
to
need
description
,
sometimes
at
such
au
elevation
that
the
eye
can
scarcely
follow
it
,
sometimes
so
near
the
earth
that
the
grasses
wave
under
the
rush
of
its
out.spread
wings
.
As
a
cage-bird
the
Swallow
is
a
mistake
;
he
sits
upon
his
perch
all
day
looking
miserable
,
rarely
moving
excepting
to
eat
or
drink
:
specimens
have
been
exhibited
at
the
Crystal
Palace
shows
,
held

:
in
one
case
the
bird
was
awarded
a
prize

it
only
had

perfect
wing

as
a
rule
the
staple
food
placed
in
the
cage
for
the
consumption
of
these
unhappy
captives
consisted
of
gentles
.
So
far
as
I
can
judge
,
the
object
of
the
owners
of
caged
Swallows
is
,
not
to
make
their
pets
happy
,
but
to
rush
them
from
one
show
to
another
,
in
the
hope
of
gaining
many
awards

their
prisoner
dies

unfortunates

THE
House-Martin
breeds
througliout
Europe
,
ranging
even
further
north
than
the
Swallow
.
Seebohm
sa3's
of
it
:
—
"
It
occasionally
straggles
to
the
Canaries
and
Madeira
,
and
breeds
abundantly
in
North-west
Africa
.
In
Egypt
and
Nubia
it
is
only
known
on
migration
;
but
it
breeds
in
Palestine
,
Asia
Minor
,
and
Persia
.
Scarcely
anything
is
known
of
its
winter
quarters
,
which
probably
are
somewhere
in
Central
Africa
.
A
few
birds
are
supposed
to
winter
in
Algeria
,
and
stragglers
are
said
to
occur
in
Turkestan
and
India
.
"
Generally
distributed
throughout
Great
Britain
,
with
the
exception
of
the
Outer
Hebrides
.
The
adult
Martin
has
the
upper
parts
to
the
rump
glossy
blue-black
;
the
rump
,
inner
tail-coverts
,
and
under
parts
pure
white
;
wings
and
tail
brownish-↵black
,
slightly
tinted
with
greeu
;
bill
black
;
feet
horu
-yellowish
,
but
densely
covered
\vith
fine
white
feathering
;
iris
hazel
.
Female
similar
to
the
male
;
perliaps
a
trifle
smaller
.
Young
birds
are
smok\-
-brown
above
,
the
rump
and
under
parts
sordid
white
;
the
innermost
secondaries
tipped
,
and
most
of
the
quills
edged
with
white
;
the
tail
shorter
and
less
forked
.
Apart
from
its
colouring
,
this
species
is
easily
distinguished
on
the
wing
from
the
Swallow
b}'
the
absence
of
the
long
tapering
points
to
the
outside
tail
feathers
;
but
the
w^hite
rump
is
also
usually
very
conspicuous
.
The
IMartin
arrives
in
this
country
about
a
week
later
than
the
Swallow
;
that
is
to
say
between
the
middle
and
end
of
April
,
according
to
the
nature
of
the
season
;
it
usually
leaves
again
between
the
end
of
September
and
beginning
of
October
,
though
stragglers
have
been
known
to
linger
even
to
December
.
In
its
habits
and
haunts
this
species
much
resembles
the
Swallow
:
why
Seebohm
went
out
of
his
way
to
assert
that
"
its
legs
are
too
short
to
allow
it
to
w-alk
"
I
do
not
understand
;
for
it
certainl}'
can
not
only
walk
,
but
run
nimbly
for
short
distances
,
without
erecting
its
wings
;
though
,
if
in
a
hurry
,
it
uses
its
wings
to
assist
it
in
taking
surprising
leaps
.
The
call-note
of
the
Martin
is
a
thin
whistled
sound
,
something
like
szeci
;
the
song
a
modulated
twittering
.
The
House
-
Martin
builds
its
nest
against
a
wall
,
and
immediately
below
and
up
to
a
projecting
ledge
;
rectangular
eaves
of
houses
are
preferred
,
but
sometimes
projecting
bricks
on
railway
-
and
other
arches
are
used
,
or
ledges
of
rock
;
the
nest
being
completely
closed
in
with
the
exception
of
a
semi-circular
or
denii
-
semi-circular
hole
at
the
top
,
and
usually
in
the
centre
.
The
nest
is
formed
of
mud
without
,
and
with
hardly
any
admixture
of
grass
or
hair
;
it
is
consequently
so
much
more
brittle
than
that
of
the
Swallow
,
that
,
with
the
greatest
care
,
using
a
long
sharp
table-knife
,
I
never
succeeded
in
obtain-↵ing
a
perfect
specimen
;
indeed
most
nests
fall
into
fragments
at
the
first
attempt
to
detach
them
,
leaving
nothing
but
the
lining
with
the
eggs
in
the
hand
held
below
as
a
support
:
this
lining
consists
of
dry
grass
,
and
sometimes
,
but
not
invariably
,
a
few
feathers
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
;
in
form
the}'
are
generally
elongated
ovals
,
pure
white
,
and
immaculate
,
but
appearing
ros}'
when
fresh-laid
;
they
are
smooth
and
thin
shelled
,
moderately
glossy
,
but
not
exactly
shiny
.
"
When
attempting
in
vain
to
secure
a
perfect
nest
of
this
species
,
it
has
often
surprised
me
that
the
mere
weight
of
the
nestlings
does
not
burst
the
fragile
mud
shell
;
the
glutinous
saliva
of
the
bird
is
supposed
to
assist
in
uniting
the
mud
pellets
in
the
first
instance
,
but
one
would
expect
a
driving
rain
to
be
more
than
sufficient
to
counteract
that
slight
advantage
:
why
this
species
so
rarely
uses
ha}'
and
hair
to
strengthen
its
walls
is
another
puzzle
,
for
the
additional
stability
which
it
gives
to
a
Swallow
's
nest
is
so
considerable
;
that
,
taking
a
metal
dipper
filled
with
ha}-
to
the
top
of
a
chimney
,
I
have
onl_v
had
to
lower
the
edge
of
the
metal
pan
below
the
nest
and
jerk
it
upwards
,
to
secure
the
nest
uninjured
.
The
food
of
the
Martin
consists
wholly
of
insects
,
which
it
obtains
on
the
wing
;
in
confinement
,
however
,
it
readily
feeds
upon
the
usual
soft
food
.
In
the
first
week
of
Jul}'
,
1891
,
my
colleague
,
Mr.
\V
.
R.
Ogilvie
Grant
obtained
a
nest
of
four
AIartins
about
a
week
old
,
and
gave
them
to
me
.
Following
out
the
mistaken
notions
of
many
aviculturists
I
at
first
fed
these
j'ouug
birds
partly
upon
raw
rump-steak
finely
minced
;
but
I
also
gave
them
a
mixture
of
carefully
selected
ants
'
cocoons
,
and
preserved
j-olk
of
egg
,
ground
up
in
a
mortar
with
maizena
wafers
,
the
whole
carefully
mixed
together
,
and
slightly
damped
.
Upon
this
diet
all
four
attained
their
full
size
,
after
which
they
refused
the
raw
meat
,
but
continued
to
eat
the
mixture
greedily
.
I
kept
these
birds
in
a
basket
filled
with
hay
,
and
several
times
each
da}'
they
were
taken
out
and
encouraged
to
fly
about
the
room
;
but
now
they
began
to
object
to
return
to
the
close
confinement
of
their
basket
;
therefore
I
purchased
a
large
cage
,
hung
up
a
cocoa-nut
nest
lined
with
flannel
in
one
corner
,
and
taught
them
to
retire
to
it
every
evening
,
or
whenever
they
appeared
to
feel
the
cold
.
At
the
end
of
a
month
the
IMartins
were
able
to
feed
themselves
,
and
,
like
all
the
Hinindinida:
when
accustomed
to
soft
food
,
they
ate
far
more
than
was
good
for
them
.
I
now
tried
a
change
of
diet
,
giving
"
Abrahams
'
Food
for
Nightingales
,
"
damped
ants
'
cocoons
,
cut
up
mealworms
,
and
flies
;
but
it
was
of
no
use
,
for
three
of
them
soon
died
of
plethora
,
and
probably
,
in
part
,
owing
to
insufficient
exercise
,
although
we
did
our
best
to
encourage
them
to
exert
themselves
in
various
ways
.
One
of
our
plans
was
to
put
all
four
on
the
ground
at
one
end
of
the
room
,
then
run
to
the
other
end
and
call
them
:
this
was
the
signal
for
a
most
comical
race
,
in
which
at
first
they
ran
at
a
surprising
rate
though
very
awkwardly
;
but
,
as
they
became
excited
in
the
race
,
used
their
wings
,
and
finished
with
a
series
of
astounding
leaps
,
finally
flying
on
to
our
arms
,
and
either
running
up
our
sleeves
,
nestling
down
in
the
hollowed
palms
of
our
hands
,
or
perching
on
our
shoulders
.
My
son
used
often
to
hold
one
up
in
his
hand
,
and
it
invariably
sprang
up
and
pecked
his
nose
,
but
only
one
of
the
four
would
do
this
.
x^lthough
naturally
so
greedy
,
our
Martins
w^ould
always
leave
their
food
and
fly
to
us
when
called
;
they
could
not
,
therefore
,
be
accused
,
like
most
cage-↵birds
,
of
cupboard-love
;
they
were
also
unlike
other
birds
in
their
fondness
for
being
handled
and
stroked
.
My
fourth
bird
lived
until
the
morning
of
September
18th
,
and
became
a
general
pet
:
his
cage
was
kept
in
a
small
spare
room
,
tlie
wire
door
being
usualljr
left
open
,
so
that
he
conld
go
out
and
in
at
pleasure
;
every
day
,
as
soon
as
I
returned
from
town
,
I
used
to
run
up
and
call
him
,
and
he
would
at
once
fly
to
me
and
nestle
down
in
my
hand
.
Towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
appeared
to
feel
the
cold
,
and
usually
retired
earlj^
to
his
cocoa-nut
nest
,
but
he
generall}-
tumbled
out
as
soon
as
he
heard
ni}-
footstep
.
Two
days
before
he
died
his
cage
door
was
shut
and
he
had
got
into
his
snuggery
,
but
I
called
out
,
"
Well
little
chap
,
how
are
you
'i
"
In
a
moment
his
head
was
popped
out
and
he
sprang
to
the
cage-↵door
:
I
opened
it
,
stepped
back
to
the
end
of
the
room
and
called
him
,
and
he
immediately
flew
across
as
usual
.
I
do
n't
think
I
was
ever
more
fond
of
any
pet
than
I
was
of
that
House-↵Martin
,
and
I
felt
his
death
acutel}'
:
but
,
nevertheless
,
I
do
not
recommend
the
species
as
a
cage-bird
;
its
wings
are
so
long
,
and
its
legs
so
short
,
that
the
primaries
constantly
get
dragged
through
the
dirt
and
need
frequently
cleansing
,
which
tends
to
give
the
birds
cold
.
A
long
and
well-warmed
corridor
would
make
a
suitable
aviary
for
them
.

OF
the
distribution
of
this
bird
outside
the
British
Islands
,
Howard
Saunders
writes
:
—
"
In
the
Faroes
and
Iceland
the
Sand-Martin
has
not
yet
been
obtained
,
but
on
the
Continent
it
is
generally
distributed
from
70°
N.
lat
.
to
the
Mediterranean
in
summer
;
while
it
also
breeds
sparingly
in
the
northern
districts
of
Africa
,
and
abundantly
in
Egypt
and
Palestine
.
Eastward
,
it
is
found
across
Asia
;
on
the
American
Continent
it
breeds
in
large
colonies
in
Alaska
,
and
up
to
68°
N.
lat
.
on
the
Mackenzie
River
;
and
we
trace
it
to
Newfoundland
.
In
winter
it
vists
Mexico
,
Central
America
,
and
the
valley
of
the
Amazon
;
and
—
in
the
Old
World
—
China
,
the
Indian
region
,
and
South-eastern
Africa
down
to
Zanzibar
.
Occasionallj'
it
wanders
to
the
Canary
Islands
.
"
In
Great
Britain
this
bird
is
generally
distributed
wherever
the
nature
of
the
soil
is
suited
to
its
requirements
when
breeding
:
to
the
Shetlands
,
however
,
it
appears
to
be
only
an
occasional
visitor
.
The
adult
Sand-Martin
has
the
upper
parts
mouse-brown
,
slightly
darker
on
the
crown
and
paler
on
the
rump
;
the
wings
and
tail
blackish-brown
;
under
parts
white
,
with
a
broad
brown
band
across
the
breast
;
bill
black
;
feet
dark
brown
,
with
a
few
huffish
feathers
at
the
back
of
the
tarsus
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
nearly
resembles
the
male
,
but
is
said
to
have
a
slightly
narrower
band
across
the
breast
.
*
The
young
have
most
of
the
feathers
of
the
upper
parts
tipped
with
huffish
white
,
and
the
under
parts
,
especially
the
chin
and
throat
,
more
or
less
washed
with
buff
.
The
lMartin
reaches
our
shores
at
the
end
of
March
,
or
beginning
of
April
,
and
immediately
repairs
to
its
chosen
building
site
,
usually
a
nearly
per-↵pendicular
wall
of
hard
sand
or
gravel
,
either
on
the
bank
of
river
,
loch
,
or
lake
,
along
the
sea-shore
,
at
the
side
of
a
railway-cutting
,
a
road-side
where
the
banks
are
high
,
a
sand-
or
gravel-pit
,
or
a
brick-earth
cutting
.
Seebohm
also
mentions
having
seen
heaps
of
half-rotten
sawdust
utilized
;
but
of
whatever
substance
the
bank
may
consist
,
the
Sand-Martin
proceeds
to
excavate
a
slightly
sloping
,
or
at
times
even
a
very
obliquely
upward
slanting
tunnel
.
In
the
first
season
this
tunnel
rarely
exceeds
a
foot
,
or
at
most
eighteen
inches
,
in
length
;
and
,
if
the
bird
finds
any
obstruction
,
such
as
a
flint-stone
or
tough
root
in
the
way
,
the
tunnel
some-↵times
turns
almost
at
right
angles
,
or
even
slopes
obliquelj^
backwards
and
upwards
:
year
by
year
this
tunnel
is
excavated
further
inwards
,
until
it
sometimes
reaches
a
length
of
from
three
to
four
feet
.
At
the
end
of
the
tunnel
a
small
chamber
is
hollowed
out
,
sometimes
a
little
above
,
but
in
a
line
with
the
tunnel
,
but
often
on
one
side
of
it
;
and
in
the
bottom
of
this
chamber
the
nest
is
formed
.
The
nest
of
the
Sand-Martin
is
very
slight
,
and
loosely
constructed
of
a
little
dry
grass
,
rootlets
,
and
rarely
a
straw
or
two
;
the
lining
,
when
there
is
one
,
consists
of
feathers
;
when
the
nest
is
not
far
from
the
entrance
the
feather
lining
is
either
absent
,
or
a
few
collected
at
random
are
carelessly
pushed
into
the
centre
;
but
when
at
a
great
distance
from
the
light
,
white
feathers
are
usually
selected
and
neatl}'
arranged
,
each
feather
lying
on
its
face
with
tlie
cnrvcd
under
snrface
upwards
,
and
tlie
base
of
the
shaft
in
the
centre
of
the
nest
:
when
carefully-↵removed
from
the
burrows
,
nests
of
this
character
are
very
prett}-
;
the
pinky-white
eggs
appearing
to
lie
in
a
pure
white
flower-like
cup
;
unhappih'
a
ver}'
slight
puff
of
wind
disturbs
their
symmetry
,
whilst
the
removal
of
the
eggs
inevitably
displaces
the
lining
,
so
that
one
never
sees
a
really
perfect
]\Iartin
's
nest
in
any
collection
.
One
reason
for
the
slovenliness
of
man}'
cabinet
nests
probably
nia_v
be
,
that
where
nests
are
abundant
,
the
collector
is
satisfied
with
those
most
readily
attainable
,
and
thus
fails
to
secure
the
best-formed
specimens
.
The
eggs
vary
in
number
from
four
to
six
,
and
in
form
from
a
long
to
a
short
oval
;
in
colour
they
are
pure
white
,
very
slightl}-
gloss}-
,
and
when
freshly
laid
show
the
yolk
through
the
shell
,
which
gives
them
a
ros}-
aj^pearance
.
The
burrows
of
Sand-Martins
,
although
an
irresistible
attraction
to
the
birds'-↵nester
,
are
often
a
source
of
considerable
anno3auce
to
railway
companies
;
ever}-
year
fresh
tunnels
are
added
,
as
those
first
formed
extend
too
far
inwards
to
please
the
birds
,
one
tunnel
runs
into
another
,
is
abandoned
,
and
a
new
one
excavated
:
thus
the
bank
of
the
cutting
becomes
so
much
undermined
,
that
frosts
and
thaws
bring
about
a
land-slip
,
and
a
temporar}'
block
to
traffic
is
occasioned
.
Of
all
nests
which
I
have
taken
,
I
know
of
none
which
so
swams
with
fleas
and
ticks
as
that
of
the
Sand- Martin
;
the
young
birds
if
taken
out
and
examined
,
will
frequentl}'
be
found
to
have
large
ticks
attached
to
their
heads
,
usually
either
on
the
crown
or
nape
;
whilst
,
in
old
colonies
,
the
fleas
skip
about
in
myriads
:
how
the
poor
birds
exist
under
the
incessant
irritation
of
these
lively
vermin
is
a
puzzle
;
but
perhaps
,
like
the
African
attacked
by
cliigos
,
they
enjoy
the
sensation
.
The
call-note
of
this
bird
is
thin
and
shrill
—
a
sort
of
szvter
:
the
only
attempt
at
a
song
which
I
have
heard
is
a
short
low
twittering
,
somewhat
vaguel}'
resembling
part
of
the
song
of
the
Reed-Warbler
,
and
usuall}'
uttered
when
two
birds
meet
in
the
air
and
flutter
a
moment
before
continuing
their
onward
flight
.
Like
the
other
Swallows
,
this
bird
is
pureh^
insectivorous
;
its
food
principally
consisting
of
gnats
and
small
flics
,
which
adhere
to
its
viscid
saliva
,
as
with
wide-↵open
gape
it
pursues
them
in
the
air
:
it
has
been
stated
to
feed
its
3'oung
occa-↵sionally
with
large
dragon-flies
,
but
this
seems
rather
improbable
,
the
bodies
of
these
insects
being
so
long
,
that
(
if
given
entire
)
they
could
not
be
swallowed
b}'
such
tiny
birds
:
the
only
chance
is
,
that
the
greed
of
these
nestlings
which
,
when
fed
,
frequently
try
to
swallow
one
another
's
heads
,
might
possibly
enable
them
to
tear
the
body
of
the
dragon-fly
in
half
.
The
Sand-Martin
usually
produces
two
broods
in
the
year
,
the
first
nest
being
rarel}-
full
before
the
beginning
of
June
,
and
the
second
about
the
middle
of
July
,
or
even
later
:
the
return
migration
commences
late
iu
August
,
and
sometimes
continues
up
to
the
middle
of
October
.
As
a
cage-bird
the
Sand-Martin
can
not
be
commended
:
—
wlieu
on
a
nesting
excursion
in
Kent
,
in
Jul}-
,
1887
,
a
family
of
five
little
Sand-Martius
was
brought
to
me
:
as
the
birds
were
too
j'oiing
to
let
fl}^
I
determined
to
try
and
keep
them
as
pets
,
but
I
found
it
a
harder
task
than
I
had
anticipated
to
induce
them
to
open
their
mouths
for
the
food
(
Abrahams
'
Nightingale
Mixture
)
which
I
gave
them
.
However
,
after
nearly
a
week
's
perseverance
,
my
wife
and
a
girl
who
then
assisted
in
looking
after
my
birds
,
succeeded
iu
persuading
four
of
them
to
open
their
mouths
when
food
was
offered
.
All
five
were
then
in
excellent
health
,
though
rather
too
fat
:
they
were
very
pretty
,
and
when
sitting
on
one
's
finger
,
looked
exactly
like
diminutive
hawks
.
Unfortunately
,
although
by
this
time
the
Martins
were
well
able
to
fly
,
they
could
only
be
induced
to
do
so
if
taken
into
a
room
where
their
food
was
not
in
sight
.
In
less
than
a
fortnight
they
could
feed
them-↵selves
,
and
after
that
they
would
eat
incessantly
,
swallowing
such
huge
mouthfuls
of
the
soft
food
,
that
it
seemed
marvellous
where
they
could
stow
it
all
away
:
then
they
would
fall
asleep
,
sitting
upon
the
edge
of
the
food-pot
,
and
remain
in
a
state
of
stupor
for
perhaps
half-au-hour
,
when
they
would
wake
up
and
begin
to
gorge
again
.
Naturally
this
life
did
not
agree
with
birds
whose
nature
it
is
to
be
incessantly
on
the
move
,
and
who
get
their
food
slowly
and
iu
minute
morsels
;
they
grew
rapidly
thinner
and
weaker
,
staggered
in
their
walk
as
if
drunken
,
and
dropped
off
one
by
one
,
uutil
,
in
just
over
three
weeks
from
the
time
when
I
received
them
,
the
last
of
them
died
.
Possibly
,
if
it
had
been
practicable
for
me
to
be
at
home
to
attend
to
them
,
I
might
have
given
these
birds
their
food
at
stated
intervals
,
and
compelled
them
to
take
exercise
;
in
which
case
,
perhaps
their
lives
might
have
been
prolonged
:
but
Sand-Martius
are
not
suitable
birds
for
the
aviculturist
.
FAMILY
FRINGILLID.€
.
THIS
famil}'
consists
of
a
uumber
of
hard-billed
,
largely
seed-eatiug
,
birds
.
Howard
Saimders
011I3'
distinguishes
these
as
Finches
f
Frin^Hluur
J
and
Buntings
(
E>i!beyiziHa
J
;
but
the
Catalogue
of
Birds
,
of
the
British
Museum
,
regards
the
Grosbeaks
as
constituting
a
third
Subfamily
(
Coccothraitstiiuc
)
.
Seebohm
agreed
with
Howard
Saunders
in
uniting
the
latter
Subfamily
to
the
typical
Finches
;
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
there
is
more
difficulty
in
distinguishing
between
some
of
the
foreign
Buntings
,
aud
Grosbeaks
,
than
between
the
latter
and
the
true
Finches
.
I
would
,
in
any
case
,
rather
err
on
the
side
of
too
much
regard
for
structural
differences
,
than
on
the
opposite
side
.
The
F) hio'iUidcr
have
the
tenth
primary
,
which
is
often
well-developed
,
con-↵cealed
by
a
longer
covert
;
it
has
thus
escaped
observation
aud
been
asserted
to
be
non-existent
;
the
bill
is
hard
and
conical
,
aud
is
(
to
my
mind
)
better
described
by
the
term
"
beak
"
;
the
Finches
feed
their
young
from
the
crop
,
regurgitating
the
food
when
partially
-
digested
:
naturally
during
the
breeding
season
,
I
believe
all
are
more
or
less
insectivorous
,
although
seed
forms
their
staple
food
:
in
confinement
,
however
,
many
of
the
Finches
will
live
for
many
years
upon
seed
alone
.
The
CoccothraiisibuT
,
or
Grosbeaks
,
of
which
the
Hawfinches
are
typical
,
are
characterized
by
a
very
heavy
and
powerful
beak
,
with
hardly
any
angle
to
the
chin
;
the
nasal
bones
produced
backwards
beyond
the
front
margin
of
the
eye-↵socket
,
(

.
R.
B.
Sharpe
,

)
.
The
Fringillincc
,
or
true
Finches
,
the
type
of
which
is
our
English
Chaffinch
,
usually
have
a
somewhat
less
powerful
beak
,
with
the
angle
of
the
chin
slightly
more
defined
,
but
still
ver}'
feebly
shown
;
the
mandibles
almost
terminating
at
the
same
point
;
the
nasal
bones
not
produced
backwards
beyond
the
front
margin
of
the
eye-socket
.
The
E»ib€risi)ur
,
or
Buntings
,
of
which
our
Yellow
Ammer
ma}'
be
considered
typical
,
have
a
well-marked
angle
to
the
chin
;
the
lower
mandible
terminating
well
within
the
upper
one
,
and
not
complete!}'
closing
in
the
centre
of
the
cutting
edge
;
the
more
typical
Buntings
also
have
a
hard
horny
knob
on
the
palate
,
and
a
compression
of
the
lower
mandible
to
meet
it
;
they
also
walk
when
on
the
earth
,
and
are
largely
insectivorous
(
in
which
respects
the}'
approach
the
Chaffinch
and
Brambling
among
the
true
Finches
)
:
many
Buntings
,
however
,
are
not
walking
birds
.
The
Fringillida
are
favourite
cage-birds
,
chiefly
on
account
of
the
ease
with
which
their
food
can
be
provided
.

Linn
.
OF
tlie
geographical
distribution
of
tlie
Greenfinch
,
Dr.
Sharpe
says
that
it
inhabits
:
—
"
Europe
generall}-
;
the
countries
bordering
the
Mediterranean
;
accidental
in
Madeira
;
extending
eastwards
in
Persia
and
North-western
Turkestan
.
"
In
Great
Britain
this
conunon
and
well-known
Grosbeak
is
generally
distri-↵buted
,
breeding
in
all
suitable
localities
;
but
to
the
Orkneys
,
Hebrides
,
and
Shetlands
,
it
is
chiefly
an
autumn
and
winter
visitant
,
though
N.
B.
Kinnear
,
in
1907
,
recorded
the
fact
that
it
breeds
at
Stornoway
and
has
probably
done
so
for
some
time
.
The
Greenfinch
varies
considerably
as
regards
brilliance
of
colouring
;
the
birds
of
the
spring
immigration
being
stated
to
be
much
paler
and
brighter
in
colouring
than
the
resident
birds
:
the
latter
are
largely
added
to
in
the
autumn
,
by
the
advent
of
immense
flocks
which
arrive
in
October
on
our
eastern
coasts
.
The
adult
male
above
is
yellowish-olive
,
more
yellow
on
the
forehead
and
rump
;
greater
coverts
grey
;
primary
coverts
edged
with
yellowish
;
primaries
greyish- brown
,
edged
with
yellow
;
secondaries
with
paler
outer
webs
;
tail
feathers
yellow
at
the
base
,
blackish
at
the
ends
,
the
central
ones
largely
blackish
;
lores
blackish
;
a
broad
superciliary
yellow
stripe
;
ear-coverts
grey
;
sides
of
face
and
cheeks
yellow
,
the
latter
somewhat
greyish
;
under
parts
yellow
,
becoming
whitish
on
the
abdomen
;
flanks
greyish
;
beak
flesh-coloured
,
darker
towards
the
tip
;
feet
horn-brown
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
is
similar
in
pattern
to
the
male
,
but
slightly
smaller
,
much
duller
and
browner
,
the
feathers
of
the
head
and
mantle
with
dark
shaft-streaks
;
the
underparts
also
are
less
yellow
.
After
the
moult
the
margins
of
the
feathers
are
paler
,
and
the
3'ellow
less
bright
;
but
in
the
spring
,
as
with
many
other
species
,
the
tints
become
purer
and
more
lively
.
The
young
are
very
like
the
mother
bird
,
but
the
feathers
are
somewhat
more
streaked
;
they
acquire
the
adult
plumage
after
their
first
moult
;
but
the
colouring
does
not
attain
its
greatest
brilliancy
in
the
first
year
.
During
the
summer
months
the
Greenfinch
is
a
somewhat
skulking
bird
,
and
chiefly
haunts
the
borders
of
woods
,
parks
,
plantations
,
shrubberies
,
gardens
,
and
dense
hedgerows
;
but
in
the
winter
it
may
often
be
seen
feeding
in
compau}-
with
Sparrows
,
Chaffinches
,
and
Buntings
,
in
stubble-fields
,
farms
,
and
gardens
.
Except-↵ing
when
feeding
its
young
,
the
song
may
frequently
be
heard
;
it
is
alwaj's
bright
and
clear
,
and
some
individuals
sing
remarkably
well
,
reminding
one
somewhat
of
a
Norwich
Canary
;
only
,
unfortunately
the
song
is
always
interrupted
at
the
end
of
a
phrase
or
two
by
a
harsh
zshwee>-
,
and
terminated
with
the
same
disagreeable
note
.
The
call-note
is
a
sound
like
tirri
,
or
a
shrill
sharp
chirp
,
somewhat
resemb-↵ling
the
chink
of
the
Chaffinch
;
the
call
of
deiiance
is
the
same
as
the
harsh
note
introduced
into
its
song
;
the
call
of
the
young
for
food
resembles
that
of
many
Finches
—
chiwi
or
chirri
.
The
nest
is
very
frequently
placed
in
hawthorn
hedges
;
indeed
I
once
found
three
nests
of
this
bird
within
a
distance
of
two
yards
,
two
of
them
being
only
a
foot
apart
,
and
all
three
at
a
height
of
about
five
feet
from
the
ground
;
it
is
also
commonly
placed
in
clumps
of
tall
furze-bushes
;
I
have
also
found
it
in
laurus-↵tinus
bushes
,
in
ivy
on
walls
,
in
the
forks
of
low
trees
,
chiefly
yews
and
spruce-firs
,
and
a
friend
found
me
a
nest
among
the
twigs
sprouting
from
the
stump
of
a
branch
,
cut
from
a
tall
oak
(
about
eight
feet
from
the
ground
)
this
being
placed
at
a
greater
elevation
than
any
other
nest
of
the
species
whicli
I
have
met
with
;
Seebohm
,
however
,
speaks
of
the
Greenfinch
sometimes
selecting
a
site
"
fift}-
feet
or
more
from
the
ground
,
in
a
fork
of
an
elm
,
or
even
in
a
cavity
in
the
trunk
.
"
The
nest
varies
considerably
,
the
thickness
of
the
walls
being
from
one
to
two
inches
,
and
usually
very
firmly
,
though
occasionally'
loosely
constructed
;
the
depth
of
some
nests
is
also
double
that
of
others
;
as
regards
materials
I
can
not
do
better
than
quote
my
own
descriptions
of
eight
selected
nests
from
my
"
Handbook
of
British
Oology
"
;

(
like
a

a
nest
)
formed
of
green
moss

and
fibrous
roots
,
in
patches
,
which
give
it
an
extremely
soft
and
variegated
appearance
;
a
few
twigs
outside
,
and
a
little
hair

the
lining
.
"
In
form
the
nest
is
usually
a
fairly
regular
cup
;
but
the
nest
taken
from
sprouting
oak-twigs
,
noted
above
,
is
shaped
like
a
sabot
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
usually
five
,
and
vary
in
ground-tint
from
greenish
to
pinkish-white
,
rarely
to
pale
green
,
or
huffish
;
the
markings
are
,
more
often

chief!}'
confined
to
the
larger
end
,
and
consist
of
spots
,
comma-↵shaped
markings
,
irregular
lines
occasionall}'
,
and
blotches
of
pitchy
browu
,
or
blackish
,
with
underlying
spots
,
and
sometimes
large
blotches
of
sienna-reddish
,
or
reddish-chocolate
.
In
some
eggs
the
markings
are
principall}'
confined
to
a
zone
near
the
larger
end
,
and
sometimes
the_y
are
scattered

over
the
entire
surface

the
form
is
b}-
no

a
shortish
oval
type
being
common
,
though
all
gradations
ma}'
be
found
between
this
and
a
long
almond
or
even
spindle-shaped
type
.
The
Greenfinch
will
pair
freely
,
both
in
cage
and
aviary
,
with
the
Canary
;
and
crosses
between
it
and
the
common
Linnet

a
wild

probably
the
most
frec|ueut

which
have
been
recorded
.
In
confinement
the
Greenfinch
breeds
as
readily
as
a
Canary
,
and
brings
up
its
young
much
better
,
not
attempting
to
pluck
them
(
like
that
foolish
bird
)
after
they
have
left
the
nest
.
It
is
very
pugnacious
in
the
breeding-season
,
dashing
straight
at
its
opponent
like
a
bull
at
a
gate
.
One
year
I
had
a
cock
Greenfinch
in
an
aviary
with
a
pair
of
Canaries
,
and
of
course
,
the
Grosbeak
fancied
it
could
easily
dispose
of
its
slim
opponent
,
and
take
possession
of
his
wife
:
so
,
with
a
harsh
defiant
zshivecr
,
it
charged
blindly
at
him
:
the
Canary
took
little
apparent
notice
of
the
Greenfinch
until
it
was
within
a
foot
or
two
,
then
with
a
graceful
little
curving
flight
he
alighted
on
its
back
,
and
plucked
out
a
beakful
of
feathers
.
This
manoeuvre
was
successfully
repeated
every
time
that
the
more
powerful
bird
attacked
him
;
so
that
at
length
the
blundering
bully
came
to
consider
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valour
.
I
found
that
a
pair
of
Greenfinches
in
an
aviary
built
in
an
ordinary
nest-box
hung
upon
the
wires
,
building
and
feeding
exactly
as
a
Canary
would
:
but
not
attempting
to
incubate
until
the
third
^^^
was
deposited
:
they
not
only
batched
all
their
eggs
,
but
brought
up
their
family
without
one
failure
.
In
the
winter
,
especially
in
severe
weather
,
this
bird
may
readily
be
caught
in
the
ordinary
cage-trap
,
especially
if
a
decoy
bird
is
placed
iu
the
cage
,
and
a
few
sunflower
seeds
upon
the
platform
.
The
larger
Grosbeaks
are
all
fond
of
these
seeds
,
and
it
is
no
uncommon
sight
in
spacious
gardens
to
see
the
ripe
sunflower
heads
covered
with
Greenfinches
biisily
at
work
extracting
every
seed
.
I
once
knew
two
old
ladies
who
were
great
breeders
of
Canaries
:
on
one
occasiou
I
called
upon
them
to
try
aud
obtain
a
cock
bird
for
breeding
purposes
;
and
,
seeing
that
they
had
paired
a
Greenfinch
and
hen
Canary
in
one
of
their
cages
,
I
asked
whj-
they
were
trying
to
breed
such
ugly
unremuuerative
mules
.
They
replied
that
their
stock
was
getting
weak
,
and
they
always
introduced
Green-↵finch
blood
when
their
birds
were
falling
off
in
vigour
,
aud
then
bred
out
the
taint
,
pairing
the
mules
with
Canaries
.
This
has
been
supposed
an
impossibility
;
yet
it
was
spoken
of
as
a
matter
of
course
.
Since
then
other
mules
,
said
to
have
been
bred
from
hybrids
,
paired
with
either
parent
stock
,
have
been
exhibited
at
the
Crystal
Palace

The
Hawfinch
.
Coccotliraustcs
vulgaris
,
PallAS
.
This
extremely
ungainly
bird
is
distributed
over
nearly
the
whole
of
Europe
;
breeding
in
Russia
as
far
northwards
as
St.
Petersburg
,
but
only
visiting
Scandinavia
in
the
winter
;
its
range
extends
eastwards
to
Asia
Minor
,
and
the
Caucasus
,
and
possibly
to
Northern
Persia
and
Turkestan
.
On
the
African
Continent
a
few
examples
breed
in
Algeria
,
and
the
species
has
been
known
to
straggle
as
far
northward
as
Egypt
.
In
Great
Britain
the
Hawfinch
is
local
,
but
according
to
the
late
Howard
Saunders
has
been
increasing
in
numbers
for
the
past
Aft}'
3-ears
;
he
attributes
this
fact
to
the
increase
of
market-gardens
.
Formerly
it
was
rare
in
Wales
and
the
extreme
western
counties
from
Cornwall
to
Cumberland
;
but
breeding
in
suitable
localities
in
most
of
the
counties
of
England
and
in
Ireland
.
To
Scotland
it
is
still
chiefly
an
accidental
winter
visitant
,
though
one
nest
was
obtained
in
1903
near
Newport
,
in
the
east
of
Fifesliire
.
Although
the
form
of
the
Hawfinch
is
anything
but
graceful
,
its
colouring
is
rather
pleasing
:
—
The
adult
male
has
the
head
of
a
ciunamon
-brown
colour
,
a
line
round
the
base
of
the
bill
,
the
lores
,
chin
,
and
throat
,
black
;
the
nape
is
smoky
gre}-
;
the
back
and
scapulars
dull
chestnut
,
somewhat
paler
on
the
rump
,
and
becoming
rather
j-ellower
on
the
upper
tail-coverts
;
wings
bluish-black
,
the
median
coverts
white
;
the
quills
with
a
white
patch
near
the
middle
of
their
inner
webs
,
gradually
increasing
on
the
inner
feathers
,
and
tipped
with
blue
;
the
tail-coverts
cinnamon-brown
,
much
elongated
;
tail
feathers
black
,
white
at
the
extremit}'
of
the
inner
webs
:
under
surface
of
body
pale
Dove-brown
,
fading
to
white
on
the
under
tail-coverts
;
beak
in
summer
bluish-grey
,
darker
at
the
tip
;
in
winter
brownish
ilesh
-coloured
;
feet
flesh-coloured
;
iris
whitish
.
The
female
is
duller
in
colour
,
with
the
white
markings
less
pure
.
The
3'Oung
are
without
black
on
the
throat
,
or
grey
on
the
nape
;
the
head
is
also
yellower
,
and
the
under
surface
of
the
body
whiter
;
the
mantle
is
mottled
,
and
the
breast
and
flanks
are
barred
with
dark
brown
.
The
Hawfinch
is
resident
with
us
;
but
it
is
probable
that
at
least
some
of
the
young
leave
our
shores
at
the
approach
of
winter
,
their
places
being
taken
by
immigrants
from
the
north
:
in
the
autumn
they
not
infrequently
fly
into
the
nets
of
the
birdcatchers
,
and
are
disposed
of
at
ver}?
moderate
prices
.
During
the
summer
months
the
Hawfinch
is
an
exceedingly
shy
bird
,
and
is
far
more
frequently
heard
than
seen
;
its
call-note
,
consisting
of
a
whistle
four
times
repeated
,
and
drawn
out
at
the
finish
,
being
familiar
to
most
frequenters
of
its
haunts
;
the
harsh
Greenfinch-like
sound
,
sometimes
mistaken
for
its
call-note
,
is
probably
its
cr}'
of
defiance
.
The
song
is
a
ver}'
inferior
performance
of
short
duration
,
some-↵what
like
that
of
an
inferior
Greenfinch
.
The
Hawfinch
frequents
well-wooded
localities
,
such
as
forest-clearings
,
small
woods
,
plantations
,
shrubberies
,
heavily
timbered
parks
,
where
patches
of
3'ews
or
hawthorn
and
bramble
are
left
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
landscape
,
and
old
orchards
;
in
such
places
it
builds
,
varying
the
site
of
the
nest
according
to
the
haunt
which
it
frequents
;
thus
in
a
wood
or
clearing
it
usuall}^
makes
its
home
in
some
old
hawthorn
,
tangled
with
blackberry-vines
,
or
in
a
holl}'
,
or
on
the
branch
of
a
fir
,
oak
,
or
beech-tree
,
some
fifteen
to
thirty
feet
from
the
ground
;
but
in
an
orchard
,
an
old
lichen-covered
apple
or
pear-tree
is
chosen
.
The
nest
of
this
bird
most
nearly
resembles
that
of
a
Biillfinch
,
being
very
shallow
,
and
alwa3-s
formed
in
a
foundation
of
twigs
;
one
which
I
found
in
course
of
formation
,
had
the
whole
of
this
external
structure
formed
of
strongly
spined
interlaced
twigs
of
hawthorn
,
from
which
all
the
leaves
had
been
stripped
,
and
presented
a
most
formidable
appearance
;
sometimes
,
however
,
the
twigs
are
intermixed
with
coarse
roots
and
dead
plants
,
and
ornamented
with
lichens
;
the
uest
itself
is
built
of
dead
grasses
aud
bents
,
and
the
lining
consists
of
rootlets
and
hair
:
altogether
it
is
so
large
that
the
Wood-Pigeon
has
been
known
to
add
a
few
twigs
to
it
,
and
thus
adapt
it
to
its
own
purposes
.
*
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
though
five
is
the
usual
complement
;
they
are
pale
bluish
or
bufl&sh
-green
in
colour
,
and
vary
in
pattern
between
that
of
the
Common-
aud
Reed- Buntings
,
the
surface
spots
,
blotches
,
aud
streaks
being
deep
pitch-brown
,
with
underlying
spots
of
lilaciue-gre}'
:
in
size
and
form
they
correspond
pretty
closel}'
with
eggs
of
the
Common
Bunting
.
The
flight
of
the
Hawfinch
is
rapid
and
powerful
,
somewhat
undulating
when
the
bird
is
passing
from
tree
to
tree
,
but
more
direct
when
long
distances
are
covered
.
On
the
wing
it
often
utters
a
peculiar
clicking
sound
,
a
kind
of
tic
,
which
may
also
sometimes
be
heard
when
the
bird
is
caged
.
The
food
consists
largely
of
seeds
,
those
of
the
hornbean
being
much
relished
;
but
when
feeding
its
young
it
devours
insects
,
especially
caterpillars
,
and
probably
buds
;
later
in
the
3'ear
peas
,
cherr^'
-kernels
,
beech-mast
,
yew-berries
,
and
haws
are
eaten
.
In
confinement
sunflower-seeds
,
hemp
,
oats
,
beech-nuts
,
canar}-
,
and
millet
may
be
given
.
Personally
I
have
had
but
little
experience
of
the
Hawfinch
as
a
cage-bird
.
On
September
i4tli
,
1893
,
a
birdcatcher
brought
me
a
specimen
which
had
flown
into
his
nets
:
he
was
evidently
afraid
to
handle
it
,
and
cautioned
me
against
attempting
to
touch
it
without
gloves
,
saying
that
its
bite
was
frightful
and
drew
blood
;
however
I
soon
had
the
bird
in
my
hand
and
caged
it
;
but
,
although
I
placed
the
cage
on
a
high
shelf
,
the
Hawfinch
never
became
tame
,
but
so
wore
the
feathers
of
its
wings
and
tail
by
its
efi^orts
to
escape
,
that
when
after
a
few
weeks
of
captivity
it
died
,
the
skin
was
not
worth
preserving
.
I
am
,
therefore
,
convinced
that
the
Hawfinch
should
either
be
turned
into
a
large
aviary
,
or
be
hand- reared
.
Speaking
of
a
pair
taken
from
the
uest
and
brought
to
him
in
1880
,
the
late
Lord
Lilford
says
:
—
"
My
two
caged
Hawfinches
*
*
readily
devoured
meal-worms
and
house-flies
,
but
I
imagine
that
this
is
an
unnatural
and
acquired
taste
.
"
In
this
I
think
his
Lordship
was
in
error
,
for
there
can
be
nothing
unnatural
in
a
bird
largely
reared
upon
partly
digested
caterpillars
,
subsequently
eating
mealworms
.
Ripe
apples
would
probably
be
a
welcome
addition
to
its
prison-diet
;
for
,
according
to
Mr.
Horatio
Fillmer
,
of
Brighton
,
the
Black-tailed
Hawfinch
is
especially
fond
of
fruit
.
As
a
pet
the
Hawfinch
has
but
little
to
recommend
it
;
it
is
not
a
pretty
bird
,
is
quarrelsome
,
spiteful
,
and
can
on
no
account
be
trusted
in
an
aviary
with
an}'
species
weaker
than
itself
.
It
is
,
moreover
,
full}'
as
much
trouble
to
its
owner
in
respect
of
food
as
many
a
far
more
attractive
species
:
j-et
,
according
to
the
late
Rev
.
H.
A.
Alacpherson
,
it
has
one
merit
;
although
its
own
song
is
insig-↵nificant
,
the
Hawfinch
is
not
wholl}'
destitute
of
the
imitative
facult}'
.
In
ni}'
friend
the
late
Charles
A.
Witchell
's
interesting
work
on
tlie
"
Evolution
of
Bird-↵song
,
"
we
read
(
p.
172
)
:
"
Even
so
poor
a
songster
as
the
Hawfinch
will
imitate
when
a
captive
.
The
Rev
.
H.
A.
Macpherson
imforms
me
that
they
will
pick
up
any
soiinds
.
"
Nevertheless
,
when
a
bird
has
no
beaut}^
of
form
,
and
when
its
colouring
is
little
superior
to
that
of
a
hen
Chaffinch
,
its
song
should
compensate
for
other
deficiencies
;
and
,
as
Major
Alexander
von
Home3'er
remarks
(
Gefiederte
Welt
,
Vol
.
XX
,
p.
4S9
)
the
cherry-kernel
biter
is
"
not
gifted
with
natural
song
.
"
It
appears
to
me
that
,
in
dealing
with
British
birds
,
it
is
far
more
convenient
to
introduce
the
Bullfinches
(
the
so-called
Gro.sbeaks
)
immediately
after
the
true
Grosbeaks
:
in
their
habits
the}-
are
not
dissimilar
;
whereas
,
to
place
them
,
as
Howard
Saunders
has
done
in
his
"
Mauual
,
"
between
the
more
slender-billed
Finches
and
the
Buntings
,
seems
rather
unnatural
:
I
have
,
therefore
,
not
followed
him
in
this
respect
.
There
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
,
so
far
as
their
habits
are
concerned
,
the
most
typical
Finches
(
that
is
the
members
of
the
genus
Fyi>igiIIa
)
approach
far
more
closely
to
the
Buntings
than
au}'
other
species
of
the
Subfamily
,
and
next
to
I^ri)ioi/ln
,
I
should
consider
Piisser
(
in
spite
of
its
aberrant
nest
)
to
show
relationship
to
the
Emberizina:
:
I
speak
as
an
Avicultiirist
of
course
,
and
do
not
venture
to
criticize
the
classification
from
a
structural
standpoint

HOWARD
SAUNDERS
gives
the
following
account
of
the
distribution
of
this
species
,
aud
its
claims
to
be
regarded
as
British
seem
to
be
well
supported
:
—
It
"
inhabits
the
coniferous
forests
of
Northern

;
wandering
in

Heligoland
,
North

,
Holland
,
Belgium
,
the
North

Ireland
,
on
May
nth
,
1802
,
and
in

August
,
1868
,
a
second
was
obtained
in

were
shot
,
six

(
known
as
the
"
White-winged
Crossbill
"
)
has
,
on
several
occasions
,
been
obtained
upon
our
shores
;
but
,
considering
the
numbers
of
American
Passeres
imported
yearly
to
this
country
,
it
would
be
indeed
surprising
if
some
of
them
did
not
fall
victims
to
the
desire
implanted
in
the
hearts
of
many
collectors
to
secure
every
strange
bird
which
the}'
see
;
moreover
,
quiet
and
confiding
as
the
Crossbills
and
Rose-finches
are
in
confinement
,
they
are
in
some
respects
far
less
attractive
pets
than
many
other
birds
;
therefore
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
the
owner
might
weary
of
them
,
and
give
them
their
liberty
.
This
near
relative
of
our
common
species
,
agrees
ver}-
closely
with
it
in
its
habits
,
frequenting
and
breeding
iu
forests
of
conifers
,
and
feeding
largely
upon
the
seeds
of
these
trees
:
in
confinement
it
is
said
to
be
very
fond
of
apples
;
but
I
suspect
,
as
is
the
case
with
the
common
Crossbill
,
it
merely
chews
up
and
drops
the
fruit
iu
order
to
secure
the
pips
,
which
these
birds
eat
with
great
relish
.
The
nest
is
described
by
Mr.
Dresser
,
as
chiefly
differing
from
that
of
L.
curvirostra
iu
being
smaller
and
slighter
;
the
eggs
also
are
said
to
resemble
very
closely
those
of
the
common
species
,
but
are
smaller
and
darker
.
The
song
is
stated
to
be
superior
;
but
,
as
the
common
Crossbill
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
a
song
worth
meutiouing
,
it
need
not
be
especially
meritorious
on
that
account
;
indeed
,
Herr
Mathias
Rausch
speaks
of
the
Crossbills
collectively
(
Gefiederte
Welt
,
Vol
.
XX
,
p.
396
)
as
of
trifling
value
as
cage-birds
,
on
account
of
their
song
;
with
which
opinion
Major
Alexander
von
Homeyer
(
p.
489
)
agrees
.
Herr
Gatke
says
that
in
18S9
this
species
"
occurred
more
frequently
(
on
Heligoland
)
than
on
any
previous
occasion
.
On
the
14th
of
August
I
obtained
a
beautiful
scarlet-red
male
,
and
an
old
female
.
On
the
1st
,
i6tli
,
18th
,
20th
,
and
22nd
of
September
,
from
two
,
five
,
up
to
eight
males
and
females
were
seen
daily
,
accompanied
by
larger
numbers
of
the
common
species
;
but
among
all
these
only
one
bird
in
the
grey-
and
black-striped
early
dress
.
For
my
collection
I
stuffed
three
fine
red
old
males
,
a
younger
yellow
male
,
two
old
females
,
and
the
young
bird
already
mentioned
.
A
large
number
were
consigned
to
cages
by
fanciers
:
some
of
them
having
been
sold
,
the
rest
subsequently
died
out
.

ACCORDING
to
Dr.
R.
Bowdler
Sharpe
,
tliis
species
inhabits
"
the
gi-eater
part
of
Europe
and
Northern
Asia
,
to
Japan
and
North
China
,
Himakn-as
,
North
America
as
far
as
Mexico
.
lu
Great
Britain
,
the
Crossbill
is
principall}'
confined
during
the
summer
mouths
to
the
pine
forests
of
Scotland
;
though
it
has
bred
in
several
of
the
eastern
counties
of
Ireland
,
and
in
Tipperary
,
as
well
as
in
North
Wales
and
some
of
the
counties
of
England
:
here
,
however
,
it
is
most
frequently
met
with
during
the
winter
,
.sometimes
in
flocks
,
though
often
only
in
small
parties
.
In
colouring
this
species
nearly
resembles
the
Two-barred
Crossbill
,
excepting
in
the
absence
of
the
white
tips
to
the
greater
and
median
wing-coverts
:
perhaps
the
male
is
a
little
less
brilliant
in
colour
,
and
the
female
a
little
more
orange
;
but
as
these
birds
vary
in
these
respects
with
age
,
it
is
not
safe
to
speak
positively'
:
one
thing
is
certain
—
that
,
in
captivity
the
red
colouring
is
entireh-
lost
after
the
first
moult
;
but
whether
permanently
it
is
not
safe
to
sa_v
without
experimenting
,
inasmuch
as
many
birds
,
notably
the
American
Nonpareil
(
Cyaiiospiza
ciris
)
lose
their
red
colouring
in
the
same
manner
;
yet
the
Nonpareil
,
at
an}-
rate
if
exposed
in
an
airy
and
sunny
aviary
for
a
j-ear
or
two
,
and
supplied
with
plenty
of
insect-food
,
reproduces
the
red
colouring
.
The
mandibles
of
the
young
bird
are
straight
,
the
lower
mandible
being
covered
by
the
cutting
edges
of
the
upper
;
but
in
the
adult
birds
it
curves
upwards
towards
the
tip
,
that
of
the
male
(
in
the
ordinary
variety
)
barely
reaching
to
a
level
with
the
culmen
of
the
upper
mandible
,
on
the
inside
if
viewed
from
above
;
that
of
the
female
,
which
has
much
the
longer
,
less
arched
,
and
more
slender
beak
,
projecting
well
above
the
culmen
on
the
outside
.
This
different
crossing
of
the
mandibles
in
the
sexes
probably
enables
the
male
to
feed
the
female
;
otherwise
it
is
difficult
to
understand
its
object
.
*
The
Crossbill
is
an
irregular
migrant
;
consequently
if
food
is
scarce
in
the
north
,
it
wanders
southward
to
search
for
sustenance
there
:
in
winter
the
species
is
more
gregarious
than
in
summer
,
tliougli
even
during
the
latter
season
Seebohm
tells
us
that
"
small
parties
of
males
may
be
seen
seeking
food
in
company
.
The}^
are
ver_y
earh'
breeders
;
and
fresh
eggs
are
usually
found
in
February
and
March
.
Eggs
have
been
taken
in
April
and
May
;
but
these
are
probably
laid
by
birds
whose
first
nests
have
been
destroyed
by
their
numerous
enemies
,
or
by
heavy
falls
of
snow
,
and
are
not
second
broods
,
as
some
ornithologists
have
supposed
.
If
these
birds
are
successful
in
rearing
a
brood
,
the
faniilj^-part}^
appear
at
once
to
commence
their
gipsy
life
.
If
they
meet
a
similar
part}^
the}'
appear
to
fraternise
at
once
,
and
form
the
nucleus
of
a
flock
,
which
is
some-↵times
seen
far
from
home
as
early
as
June
,
wandering
in
search
of
food
.
It
is
a
very
pretty
sight
to
see
these
flocks
feeding
upon
the
berries
of
the
mouutain
-ash
,
*
or
stripping
the
larch
or
spruce
trees
of
their
cones
.
In
winter
they
are
exceed-↵ingly
tame
,
and
will
allow
the
observer
to
approach
very
near
and
watch
them
without
showing
any
signs
of
alarm
.
They
are
very
active
,
and
when
busily
engaged
in
feeding
,
place
themselves
in
all
sorts
of
positions
,
like
a
Tit
or
a
Willow- Wren
.
They
pass
from
tree
to
tree
with
strong
but
undulating
flight
,
continually
calling
to
each
other
.
In
late
winter
or
early
spring
the
males
have
a
low
warbling
song
,
which
reminds
one
somewhat
of
that
of
the
Starling
.
The
female
is
said
also
to
sing
nearly
as
well
as
the
male
.

.
I
have
never
heard
the
Crossbill
sing
,
but
should
imagine
that
it
would
not
differ
greatly
from
that
of
the
so-called
"
Pine-Grosbeak
"
(
when
recording
probably
;
for
hitherto
I
have
only
heard
the
latter
utter
a
little
bubbling
chirrup
,
consisting
of
six
or
eight
notes
)
;
in
any
case
it
must
be
a
poor
song
,
if
we
are
to
trust
the
judgment
of
our
musical
friends
the
Germans
.
The
call-note
,
and
the
only
note
which
I
ever
heard
proceed
from
the
beak
of
the
Crossbill
,
is
cliip
,
chip
;
chip
,
chip
;
chip
,
chip
;
repeated
incessantly
,
from
morning
to
night
,
with
the
monotonous
regularity
of
a
pendulum
:
but
Seebohm
declares
that
the
bird
sometimes
says
tsup
,
or
tsop
;
in
which
I
think
he
must
have
allowed
his
imagination
to
lead
him
astray
,
as
it
certainly
has
when
he
likens
the
cry
to
those
of
Chaffinches
and
Linnets
.
The
horizontal
branch
of
a
fir
near
the
trunk
,
or
at
a
distance
from
the
trunk
,
or
the
forking
branches
of
a
pine
,
sometimes
not
more
than
five
feet
from
the
ground
,
are
occasionally
selected
as
building
sites
;
but
it
is
stated
that
apparently
the
favourite
position
is
almost
at
the
top
of
the
tree
,
in
the
centre
of
the
forking
branches
which
thus
form
a
sort
of
frame
in
which
to
support
it
.
The
nesl
itself
is
built
after
the
pattern
of
that
of
the
Bullfinch
,
a
foundation
of
twigs
of
Scotch
fir
,
enclosing
a
cup-shaped
structure
of
dr\-
grass
and
lichen
;
the
lining
being
formed
of
somewhat
finer
materials
,
mixed
with
moss
,
wool
,
or
feathers
.
The
eggs
number
fri)m
four
to
five
,
but
rarely-
exceed
four
;
the}'
var_v
in
colouring
from
greenish-blue
to
gre_vish
-white
,
and
are
spotted
,
speckled
,
and
sometimes
almost
streaked
with
dai-k
-brown
;
there
are
also
underlj-ing
spots
of
pale
reddish-brown
,
and
the
larger
end
is
occasionally
dusted
with
greyish
.

Whilst
feeding

the
Crossbill
feeds
largel}'
upon

,
and
other
larvae
,
also
the
chrysalides
of
a
little
moth
,
as
well
as
buds
of
trees
;
but
later
,
as
the
fir-
and
pine-cones
ripen
,
it
extracts
the
seeds
with
its
powerful
man-↵dibles
and
feasts
upon
them
.
Berries
of
various
kinds
are
largely
eaten
,
and
Seebohm
says
that
the
Crossbill
is
very
fund
of
apples
,
but
this
is
not
strictly
correct
,
for
it
simply
tears
the
fruit
to
pieces
and
drops
it
,
eating
onl}'
the
pips
;
I
frequently
observed
the
destructive
act
in
the
case
of
a
pair
of
caged
Crossbills
once
in
nn'
possession
,
but
my
birds
never
ate
the
pips
.
Lord
Lilford
(
Birds
of
Northamptonshire
,
Vol
.
I
,
pp
.
205-6
)
observes
:
—
"
We
have
geuerall_v
found
the
Crossbills
ver\-
tame
and
easy
of
approach
,
and
a
flock
of
these
birds
,
bnsil}'
emploj-ed
in
feeding
on
the
seeds
of
a
snow-laden
fir-tree
,
is
a
beautiful
and
most
interesting
sight
.
Their
actions
in
quest
of
food
very
much
resemble
those
of
the
suuiller
Parrots
as
they
cling
to
and
clamber
about
the
large
cones
,
from
which
they
extract
the
seeds
with
wonderful
rapidity
.
In
confinement
we
have
found
this
species
,
though
it
soon
becomes
perfectly
tame
,
invariably
very
restless
,
and
constantly
climbing
over
all
parts
of
its
cage
as
if
seeking
to
escape
.
As
above
mentioned
,
fir-seeds
are
the
natural
and
favourite
food
;
but
these
birds
will
readily
feed
on
hemp-seed
,
and
almost
any
of
our
common
berries
.
"
"
Although
we
have
found
our
tame
birds
ver}'
fond
of
the
pips
of
apples
,
we
never
could
induce
them
to
extract
the
said
pips
from
the
fruit
for
themselves
.
"
*
My
own
experience
of
the
Crossbill
as
a
cage-bird
agrees
very
closely
with
the
above
as
regards
its
disposition
and
behaviour
:
the
following
are
mj'
notes
on
this
species
:
In
the
winter
of
1886-7
,
my
friend
Mr.
J.
Johnston
gave
me
a
pair
of
Crossbills
,
and
within
a
week
the
cock-bird
would
take
sunflower
seeds
from
my
fingers
.
These
birds
are
quiet
but
amusing
creatures
,
much
like
Parrots
in
their
actions
.
I
placed
their
seed
in
one
of
the
ordinary
tin
hoppers
to
prevent
their
wasting
it
,
but
in
two
days
they
had
found
out
how
to
lift
up
the
lid
at
the
top
,
after
wliicli
the
cock-bird
almost
invariably
took
liis
seeds
out
there
,
clinging
head
downwards
to
the
wires
as
he
fed
:
in
a
few
days
the
Crossbills
became
accustomed
to
their
cage
,
and
immediately
set
to
work
to
do
all
the
mischief
they
could
.
They
tore
to
pieces
perch
after
perch
,
so
that
incessant
renewal
was
necessary
;
then
they
began
to
tear
awaj^
the
woodwork
of
the
cage
,
which
was
anything
but
pleasing
to
me
,
as
it
had
cost
me
more
money
than
I
could
afford
to
throw
awa}^
:
moreover
,
they
fought
for
supremacy
,
and
their
bad
language
at
such
times
was
incessant
chip-chip-i/iip
.
At
last
the
chip
of
beak
and
tongue
was
more
than
I
could
stand
,
and
I
greatly
desired
to
be
rid
of
the
dear
creatures
.
I
think
it
likel}-
that
my
Crossbills
refused
to
take
the
trouble
to
eat
apple-↵pips
,
because
they
were
well
supplied
with
sunflower-seed
,
with
which
the}-
were
perfectly
satisfied
.
On
the
6tli
February
,
1S87
,
I
removed
the
Crossbills
from
their
large
wooden-framed
flight-cage
to
a
much
sujaller
metal
prison
(
such
is
sometimes
irsed
for
Canaries
)
;
two
days
later
the
cock-bird
discovered
how
to
open
the
door
;
and
,
after
carefull}'
shutting
it
behind
him
,
flew
up
to
the
roof
of
the
greenhouse
in
which
the
cage
was
hung
,
and
amused
himself
b^^
walking
about
on
the
creepers
head
downwards
.
It
was
quite
three-quarters
of
an
hour
before
he
could
be
again
secured
in
his
cage
,
and
he
used
his
mandibles
to
some
purpose
upon
his
captor
.
The
door
of
the
cage
was
now
fastened
with
wire
,
to
prevent
another
exhibition
of
the
bird
's
skill
as
a
prison-breaker
.
On
the
morning
of
the
9th
the
cock-bird
died
,
apparently
out
of
pique
,
for
we
could
discover
no
cause
for
his
death
,
his
organs
being
all
in
perfect
condition
;
but
possibly
he
may
have
been
squeezed
when
captured
:
the
following
day
the
hen
had
a
fit
and
followed
his
example
.
Thus
my
hope
of
exchanging
my
Crossbills
for
some
less
destructive
species
were
disappointed
.

FROM
time
to
time
some
five
and
twenty
occurrences
of
this
species
in
Great
Britain
had
been
recorded
previous
to
1900
;
but
,
as
Howard
Saunders
says
:
—
"
Professor
Newton
(
4th
Ed
.
Yarrell
's
B
.
B
.
)
has
disposed
of
all
but
five
as
unworthy
of
belief
;
while
,
to
my
mind
,
few
even
of
these
sifted
records
are
entitled
to
acceptance
.
"
In
1905
a
small
flock
appeared
near
Hawkhurst
in
Kent
,
and
subsequently
in
Ashburuham
Park
,
Sussex
;
several
specimens
being
shot
.
It
seems
to
me
that
even
if
the
species
has
been
shot
here
,
the
probabilit}^
is
that
(
in
every
case
)
the
examples
have
either
escaped
or
been
freed
from
confine-↵ment
;
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
oul}-
imported
from
time
to
time
as
a
cage-bird
,
but
in
my
short
experience
(
commencing
in
Jul}'
1896
)
*
the
birds
,
though
wonderfully
tame
and
intelligent
,
are
too
powerful
and
destructive
to
be
trusted
with
weaker
companions
,
and
eat
so
voraciously
that
their
food
makes
a
distinct
difference
in
one
's
expenses
:
they
are
like
most
insect-eating
finches
,
very
fond
of
earthworms
and
green
food
;
but
the
quantity
of
sunflower-seed
and
hemp
which
they
devour
in
a
day
is
astonishing
,
whilst
their
chief
amusement
in
my
aviar}'
consisted
in
tearing
ivy
to
pieces
.
A
man
in
a
hurry
to
part
with
such
birds
would
be
verj^
likely
to
turn
them
loose
.

DR.

gives
the
distributiou
of
this
species
as
follows
:
—
"
Western
,
Central
,
and
Southern
Europe
.
The
eastern
range
is
undefined
,
but
it
apparently
ranges
as
far
as
Central
Russia
.
"
The
larger
race
known
to
aviculturists
as
"
Russian
Bullfinch
"
is
regarded
b}-
the
Doctor
as
a
distinct
species
,
which
he
calls
"
Fyrrhula
pyrrhula
y
I
must
say
I
do
not
approve
of
this
adoption
of
the
generic
name
for
the
species
,
and
should
prefer
to
follow
Brehm
in
calling
it
Pyyyhula
niajoy
:
it
occurs
in
Northern
and
Eastern
Europe
,
and
in
vSiberia
.
Of
late
years
a
good
many
examples
of
the
larger
northern
race
have
visited
the
Shetland
Islands
,
and
in
1894
two
were
obtained
in
Yorkshire
.
The
Bullfinch
,
or
Bloodolf
,
as
it
is
called
in
Norfolk
,
is
pretty
generally
distributed
in
all
well-wooded
districts
throughout
the
British
Isles
.
The
male
bird
has
the
upper
part
of
the
head
to
below
the
e3'e
and
back-↵ward
to
the
nape
,
as
well
as
the
chin
,
glossy
blue-black
;
the
mantle
and
back
bluish
ash-grey
;
the
rump
white
;
the
larger
wing-coverts
black
,
broadly
tipped
with
white
;
flights
and
tail
black
,
but
the
primaries
somewhat
ashy
on
the
inner
webs
and
the
second
to
the
fifth
with
narrow
whitish
border
to
the
emarginate
portions
:
the
outer
web
of
the
innermost
secondary
largely
suffused
with
red
:
the
sides
of
the
face
,
neck
,
and
under
surface
bright
salmon-red
,
the
vent
and
under
tail-coverts
white
;
beak
,
black
;
feet
dark
brown
,
changing
to
flesh
colour
in
confinement
;
iris
brown
.
The
female
is
slightly
duller
in
colouring
on
the
upper
parts
,
and
the
whole
of
the
red
is
replaced
by
soft
Dove-brown
.
The
young
most
nearly
resemble
the
female
,
but
have
no
black
on
the
head
,
and
a
sordid
white
wing-bar
.
It
has
often
been
said
that
feeding
entirely
on
hemp
in
confinement
has
the
effect
of
rendering
the
plumage
black
,
just
as
that
of
the
Canary
is
altered
to
orange-↵vermilion
by
extensive
cayenne
feeding
:
if
this
were
true
to
call
black
Bullfinches
rare
feathered
varieties
(
as
is
sometimes
done
at
bird
shows
)
would
be
absurd
:
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
assertion
is
probably
based
largely
upon
a
guess
at
the
cause
of
tlie
melauisni
,
whicli
may
have
been
due
to
keeping
the
birds
in
a
moist
warm
atmosphere
.
During
the
summer
months
the
Bullfinch
chief!}'
haunts
the
outskirts
of
woods
,
plantations
,
dense
shrubberies
,
private
pleasure
grounds
,
where
clumps
of
conifers
with
tangled
undergrowth
of
brambles
have
been
left
,
to
vary
the
landscape
or
to
form
cover
for
game
,
or
clearings
covered
with
two
or
three
year
's
growth
;
less
frequentl}"
lanes
skirted
b}-
tall
hedges
;
but
never
far
from
woods
.
In
such
places
it
builds
its
shallow
nest
,
and
once
I
found
one
in
a
loose
wa3-side
hazel-hedge
,
about
three
feet
high
and
quite
at
the
top
,
barely
concealed
b}'
a
leaf
.
The
favourite
site
for
the
nest
is
on
the
iipper
surface
of
a
lunnzontal
branch
of
a
spruce-fir
,
or
j-ew
;
but
I
have
also
met
with
it
in
dwarf
hawthorns
tangled
with
blackberr}'
vines
,
and
in
the
side
of
a
hawthorn
,
half
buried
by
elm-foliage
,
on
the
edge
of
a
wood
:
sometimes
a
small
box-tree
is
selected
,
or
very
rarely
a
slight
gap
in
a
tall
hedge
.
The
outer
framework
of
the
nest
consists
of
a
tangled
platform
of
slender
twigs
or
roots
,
surrounding
a
neat
,
and
sometimes
stoutly
built
,
but
usually
somewhat
frail
looking
cup
of
plaited
rootlets
and
bents
,
with
a
lining
of
root-fibre
and
black
horse-hairs
.
According
to
Seebohm
"
in
some
nests
a
little
wool
or
a
feather
or
two
are
found
,
"
but
I
never
found
either
,
though
occasionally
a
dead
leaf
drifts
into
the
ci:p
and
is
left
there
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
but
rarely
exceed
five
;
in
colour
they
ai^e
pale
blue
,
sometimes
almost
white
;
spotted
with
blackish-brown
,
mixed
with
spots
or
blotches
of
purplish
,
red-brown
,
and
now
and
then
lavender
;
most
eggs
are
chiefly
spotted
at
or
near
the
larger
end
;
sometimes
there
are
one
or
two
Bunting
markings
among
the
spots
;
rarel}'
the
zone
of
markings
occurs
near
the
smaller
end
of
the
egg
;
and
lastly
,
in
the
very
aberrant
,
almost
white
variety
,
the
whole
of
the
spots
are
chocolate-brown
diffused
at
the
edges
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
,
when
feeding
its
young
,
the
Bullfinch
eats
aphides
,
small
green
caterpillars
,
seeds
,
and
leaves
of
weeds
;
so
that
,
in
a
measure
,
it
atones
for
the
mischief
wdiich
it
does
to
the
fruit-grower
in
autumn
and
spring
.
It
is
said
that
the
Bullfinch
frequently
rears
two
broods
in
the
season
;
its
first
eggs
being
laid
towards
the
end
of
April
;
the
young
would
,
therefore
,
be
hatched
early
in
May
,
and
perhaps
be
able
to
look
after
themselves
by
the
end
of
that
month
;
the
second
nest
,
if
built
in
the
last
week
of
May
,
would
again
have
eggs
by
the
end
of
the
first
\veek
in
June
.
My
own
experience
is
that
,
in
Kent
,
nidificatiou
is
later
;
the
first
nest
having
eggs
in
the
early
part
of
May
,
and
the
second
early
in
Jul}^
so
that
the
old
birds
must
be
close
upon
,
or
in
their
moult
by
the
time
that
the
young
leave
the
nest
.
Is
it
certain
that
these
birds
would
be
reared
?
I
am
inclined
to
doubt
it
.
In
1890
a
pair
of
Bullfinches
in
one
of
my
aviaries
built
a
typical
nest
(
in
August
)
in
a
small
yew-tree
;
she
laid
four
eggs
and
sat
steadil}^
for
a
week
,
when
she
deserted
them
and
died
the
following
da}'
:
examination
showed
acute
inflammation
of
the
cloaca
;
two
of
the
eggs
,
which
I
put
under
a
Canary
,
were
hatched
but
not
reared
.
The
natural
song
of
the
Bullfinch
is
very
poor
,
reminding
one
of
a
Jew's-↵harp
;
but
hand-reared
birds
can
,
with
the
help
of
a
musical-box
,
be
taught
to
whistle
entire
tunes
very
prettily
.
The
call-note
is
a
soft
plaintive
whistle
,
diflScult
to
write
down
,
as
it
commences
without
any
initial
consonant
;
the
word
diu
which
has
been
frequently
used
to
express
it
,
bears
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
sound
;
hi
would
be
nearer
,
but
is
too
abrupt
;
ivlicoxs
abetter
rendering
.
In
the
winter
the
Bullfinch
becomes
much
less
retiring
,
and
more
confiding
in
its
habits
,
frequenting
gardens
and
orchards
:
and
in
its
love
for
buds
,
par-↵ticularl}'
of
fruit-trees
,
often
doing
considerable
mischief
:
father
,
mother
,
and
family
,
sometimes
taking
up
positions
on
the
same
tree
,
and
going
to
work
sj'stematicall}'
.
Attempts
have
often
been
made
by
well-meaning
Ornithologists
to
defend
this
action
on
the
part
of
the
Bullfinch
,
by
declaring
(
without
a
particle
of
evidence
in
favour
of
the
assertion
)
that
the
birds
are
in
reality
the
fruit-grower
's
best
friends
;
inasmuch
as
they
only
select
those
buds
which
contain
maggots
.
Such
utter
nonsense
could
only
be
written
by
those
who
have
not
studied
birds
in
captivit}'
,
and
in
large
aviaries
containing
living
shrubs
and
creepers
.
Seebohm
was
far
more
sensible
than
to
perpetuate
so
flimsy
an
excuse
,
for
he
says
;
—
"
it
is
seldom
respected
by
the
gardener
,
who
,
in
shooting
it
down
,
makes
bad
worse
,
and
does
more
damage
in
one
discharge
of
his
gun
than
a
host
of
Bullfinches
would
do
in
a
week
.
Early
in
the
3'ear
the
bird
may
often
be
seen
on
the
branches
of
cherry-
,
plum-
,
apple-
,
and
pear-trees
,
or
on
the
twigs
of
the
gooseberry-
and
currant-bushes
,
and
the
ground
is
strewed
with
the
cases
of
the
buds
,
marking
out
its
course
.
Singularly
enough
the
bird
confines
it
attentions
to
the
flower-buds
,
those
producing
leaves
being
passed
b}'
.
This
destructive
habit
of
the
Bullfinch
can
not
be
defended
or
excused
;
but
further
research
may
prove
that
the
bird
is
,
after
all
,
a
real
benefactor
to
the
tree
from
which
it
levies
such
a
costly
tribute
.
"
It
does
not
strike
me
as
singular
that
the
Bullfinch
should
prefer
the
short
stout
buds
to
the
thin
pointed
ones
,
but
that
is
a
detail
.
One
thing
must
be
borne
in
mind
,
however
,
that
,
in
the
older
trees
,
if
the
Bullfinches
reduce
the
number
of
fruit
buds
,
they
save
the
gardener
the
trouble
of
pruning
away
super-↵fluous
fruit
;
so
that
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
the
resulting
crop
may
be
just
as
good
in
the
end
,
though
with
less
trouble
to
the
grower
.
If
3'ou
want
a
tree
to
die
,
there
are
few
surer
ways
of
killing
it
than
by
boring
a
hole
into
tlie
centre
of
the
trunk
and
pouring
in
shot
;
the
gardener
who
empties
a
charge
of
shot
into
the
branches
of
his
fruit-trees
,
can
,
therefore
,
hardly
expect
them
to
be
benefited
thereb\'
.
If
he
were
wise
he
would
bait
a
cage-trap
,
catch
his
Bullfinches
and
sell
them
at
a
shilling
apiece
for
cage-birds
:
the}'
would
,
even
then
,
die
quite
soon
enough
to
satisfy
any
feelings
of
enmity
which
he
might
nourish
,
for
my
experience
of
these
birds
in
captivity
is
—
that
it
is
quite
exceptional
for
them
to
become
really
tame
even
in
large
aviaries
;
consequently
,
unless
hand-reared
,
they
rarely
live
for
more
than
eighteen
months
in
captivity
.
When
first
turned
loose
in
an
aviary
,
a
cock
Bullfinch
always
creates
a
panic
;
his
brilliant
colouring
seems
to
greatly
alarm
other
Finches
,
so
that
his
flight
through
the
midst
of
them
produces
much
the
same
result
as
the
rush
of
a
bull
through
a
crowded
street
.
Yet
this
powerful
looking
bird
is
really
most
inoffensive
;
if
annoyed
he
only
opens
his
mouth
aud
makes
grimaces
,
and
if
he
does
become
tame
,
he
is
not
long
in
doing
so
:
one
which
I
had
was
tempted
to
take
sunflower-↵seeds
from
my
fingers
three
weeks
after
its
capture
:
a
Canary
,
with
which
I
paired
it
,
was
far
less
afraid
of
it
than
our
indigenous
Finches
were
.

(

an

.

Although
there
is
no
absolute
proof
that
the
few
specimens
of
this
species
which
have
been
obtained
in
Great
Britain
may
not
all
have
escaped
from
con-↵finement
,
the
Serin
being
a
well-known
and
tolerably
freely
imported
cage-bird
;
the
fact
that
it
breeds
in
the
Netherlands
,
renders
it
quite
possible
,
and
even
probable
,
that
they
ma}'
have
been
stragglers
to
our
coasts
.
Seebohm
observes
:
—
"
It
is
said
that
a
Serin
was
caught
near
Portsmouth
,
in
April
,
1852
,
another
at
Taunton
,
in
1866
,
and
a
third
at
Worthing
,
in
1869
;
but
by
far
the
greater
number
are
those
brought
by
the
Brighton
bird-catchers
to
Mr.
Swaj'sland
.
Rarely
a
year
passes
without
two
or
three
being
thus
obtained
,
although
it
sometimes
happens
that
none
are
caught
for
a
couple
of
years
.
"
One
was
seen
at
Beverley
,
Yorks
,
in
1897
.
Two
were
caught
at
Dover
,
one
near
Yarmouth
,
in
1904
,
and
one
was
seen
near
Crowmarsh
,
Oxford
;
a
female
was
caught
at
Rottingdean
,
Sussex
,
in
1906
;
and
some
were
reported
near
Lewes
,
in
1907
.
The
claim
of
this
bird
to
be
included
in
the
British
list
is
,
therefore
,
considerably
greater
than
that
of
the
Scarlet
Rose-finch
,
a
bird
generally
to
be
obtained
in
Calcutta
,
and
frequently
included
in
consignments
of
cage-birds
from
India
.
*
The
male
Serin
,
of
which
the
wild
Canary
is
considered
to
be
a
sub-species
,
has
the
forehead
,
a
superciliary
streak
,
the
rump
,
and
the
under-parts
,
bright
yellow
;
the
under
tail-coverts
are
,
however
,
almost
white
,
and
the
flanks
streaked
with
brown
;
the
remainder
of
the
body
,
as
well
as
the
wing
and
tail-feathers
,
are
deep
olive-brown
,
mostly
with
j-ellowish
margins
;
but
the
greater
wing-coverts
and
secondaries
are
margined
with
sordid
white
;
beak
dark
horn-brown
,
paler
at
the
base
of
the
lower
mandible
;
feet
pale
brown
;
iris
dark
brown
.
The
female
is
duller
and
more
prominently
streaked
than
the
male
,
and
in
the
winter
both
sexes
are
distinctly
duller
than
in
the
summer
.
The

As
bearing
upon
the
cpiestion
whether
or
not
the
Serin
is
likely
,
from
time
to
time
,
to
visit
England
,
the
following
note
by
Herr
Gatke
is
of
interest
:
—
"
Now
,
although
one
can
hardly
expect
to
hear
of
this
bird
building
a
nest
in
Heligoland
,
the
occurrence
here
of
five
young
grey
individuals
during
the
summer
months
at
all
events
seems
to
admit
of
the
conclusion
that
these
birds
may
have
been
bred
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
island
,
perhaps
in
Slcswick
-Holstein
.
I
do
not
,
how-↵ever
,
share
the
view
that
breeding
attempts
of
this
kind
,
made
in
districts
far
distant
from
the
regular
home
,
justify
one
in
assuming
an
extension
of
the
breeding
area
.
"
It
is
conceivable
,
that
birds
bred
far
from
their
usual
.summer
haunts
,
might
at
the
season
of
migration
,
join
a
stream
of
migrants
,
which
would
land
them
on
our
shores
.
According
to
Naumann
,
the
Serin
prefers
the
hill}'
,
cultivated
districts
to
the
plains
,
chiefly
frequenting
orchards
,
plantations
,
avenues
of
fruit-
and
walnut-↵trees
,
vineyards
,
and
even
gardens
in
the
middle
of
villages
,
or
close
to
houses
.
Dixon
,
who
met
with
it
in
Algeria
,
observes
(
Jottings
about
Birds
,
p.
59
)
—
"
It
is
widely
distributed
,
not
only
in
the
mountain
districts
,
but
in
the
more
northern
oases
.
"
Also
,
in
his
notes
qnoted
by
Seebolim
(
British
Birds
,
Vol
.
II
,
p.
85
)
—
"
It
is
a
bird
that
appears
to
love
the
richest
districts
,
and
we
never
met
with
it
in
the
pine-
and
cedar-forests
on
the
Aur^s
.
In
the
oases
the
birds
inhabited
the
Inxuriant
gardens
,
the
groves
of
fig-trees
,
and
were
seen
amongst
the
apricot-↵trees
and
wealth
of
shrubs
beautifull_v
clothed
in
the
fairest
of
blooms
.
But
amongst
this
semi-tropical
verdure
,
the
Serin
is
difficult
to
see
,
and
you
only
catch
a
hasty
glimpse
of
it
as
it
appears
on
the
outermost
branches
for
a
moment
and
then
disappears
again
.
Amongst
the
date-palms
,
however
,
it
is
very
conspicuous
.
There
is
little
or
no
underwood
beneath
these
trees
,
and
the
bird
perches
exclusively
upon
them
.
It
was
seen
sitting
on
the
topmost
puint
of
the
broad
leaves
,
sixty
feet
from
the
ground
,
whence
it
occasionally
took
a
little
fluttering
flight
into
the
air
to
catch
an
insect
from
the
swarms
flitting
round
the
tree-tops
.
All
the
Finches
in
summer-↵time
are
more
or
less
insectivorous
,
and
the
little
Serin
is
no
exception
;
indeed
it
seems
most
industrious
in
its
search
after
insects
,
not
only
flitting
into
the
air
but
occasionally
clinging
to
the
stems
of
the
palm-trees
,
as
if
searching
for
its
food
amongst
the
rugged
bark
.
We
repeatedly
saw
it
,
too
,
upon
the
tops
of
the
walls
that
divide
the
Arab
Gardens
;
but
it
was
always
rather
shy
,
and
after
a
moment
or
two
's
rest
flew
off
to
its
usual
refuge
,
the
tops
of
the
date-palms
.
"
The
nest
is
placed
either
in
a
fruit-tree
,
or
some
other
tree
of
moderate
height
,
a
shrub
,
or
bush
;
it
is
loosely
but
neatly
constructed
of
bents
and
roots
,
compacted
together
with
vegetable
down
,
wool
,
and
spiders
'
cocoons
,
or
lichen
and
gre}^
moss
,
and
is
softly
lined
with
similar
materials
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
five
,
usually
five
,
and
chiefly
differ
from
those
of
the
Siskin
,
or
Goldfinch
,
in
their
smaller
size
,
being
verj^
pale
green
,
marked
with
dark
reddish-brown
blotches
,
spots
,
and
sometimes
lines
,
and
with
underlying
sienna- reddish
spots
;
most
specimens
are
principally
marked
at
the
larger
end
.
The
food
of
the
Serin
consists
chiefly
of
small
seeds
,
and
it
is
said
to
give
the
preference
to
those
of
an
oily
nature
:
when
rearing
its
young
,
however
,
as
is
the
case
with
other
Finches
in
a
wild
state
,
various
small
insects
are
also
eaten
,
and
doubtless
leaves
and
unripe
seeds
of
weeds
.
The
call-note
somewhat
resembles
that
of
a
Canar}-
,
a
plaintive
whect
,
but
the
song
is
described
by
Naumann
as
more
nearly
like
that
of
a
Siskin
;
and
Howard
Saunders
says
:
—
"
The
song
resembles
the
word
zi-zi
often
repeated
,
and
a
flock
of
birds
settled
in
a
tree
produces
a
peculiar
buzzing
or
almost
hissing
sound
.
"
The
bird
often
sings
on
die
wing
after
the
manner
of
the
Siskin
.
The
Serin
being
only
subspecifically
distinct
from
the
Canary
,
the
fact
recorded
by
Dr.
Carl
Russ
—
that
hybrids
between
the
two
,
proved
fertile
to
the
third
and
fourth
geiieratiou
(
Vide
Gefiederte
Welt
,
Vol
.
XX
,
p.

)
is
not
very
surprising
:
the
only
question
is
whether
the
Doctor
was
justified
in
speaking
of
them
as
"
Bastarde
.
"
Air
.
H.
C.
Martin
,
of
Old
Charlton
,
bred
three
crosses
between
the
Serin
and
Canary
in
1896
,
and
kindly
gave
a
female
to
me
,
so
that
I
hojDed
to
be
able
to
repeat
Dr.
Russ
'
experience
but
was
unsuccessful
.
Mr.
Septimus
Perkins

,
gives
his
experience
of
the
Serin
iu
captivity
;
he
sa3's
:
—
"
The
Serin
Finch
is
not
expensive
to
bu}^
but
is
uot
always
to
be
obtained
when
wanted
.
A
good
man}'
,
however
,
are
generally
brought
over
from
Germany
in
the
autumn
,
and
it
is
then
that
the
war}-
aviculturist
will
purchase
a
pair
or
two
,
with
which
he
may-↵hope
to
breed
the
following
year
.
Canar\'
and
German
rape-seed
,
with
the
dail}'
addition
of
a
little
hemp
,
suit
the
Serin
Finch
best
as
a
diet
.
I
have
al\va3's
found
him
most
inoffensive
towards
his
companions
in
the
aviary
,
a
tame
,
confiding
little
bird
,
and
,
to
m}'
mind
,
singularly
attractive
,
iu
spite
of
his
sober
colours
.
My
pair
of
vSerins
were
bought
in
the
autumn
,
when
they
were
in
very
shabby
plumage
and
not
the
best
of
health
.
In
due
time
they
improved
greatly
in
both
respects
,
but
became
,
unfortunately
,
a
great
deal
too
fat
.
In
Ma}'
of
the
following
year
the
hen
began
to
build
,
selectiug
a
corner
of
the
aviary
,
on
the
floor
of
the
room
,
as
a
nesting
place
;
although
the
aviary
abounded
with
more
suitable
spots
,
there
being
nesting
boxes
of
various
sorts
and
abundance
of
bushes
.
The
nest
was
a
neatly
formed
but
flimsy
edifice
,
rather
hastily
put
together
,
and
the
three
pretty
eggs
rolled
out
,
one
by
one
,
upon
the
floor
a
day
or
two
after
the
hen
began
to
sit
.
She
stuck
to
her
nest
so
long
as
an
egg
remained
in
it
;
but
when
the
last
rolled
out
,
she
gave
up
in
despair
.
No
other
nest
was
built
.
"
I
do
not
doubt
that
if
a
Hartz
cage
had
been
hanging
on
the
wall
,
the
Serin
would
have
built
inside
it
,
and
reared
her
brood
:
the
common
Canary
in
an
aviary
prefers
this
to
anything
else
,
and
when
it
is
not
present
,
builds
iu
a
bush
or
a
bundle
of
twigs
.
Ornithologists
have
long
differed
in
opinion
as
to
whether
the
specimens
of
the
wild
Canary
which
have
from
time
to
time
been
caught
and
killed
on
our
coasts
are
stragglers
to
Great
Britain
or
escaped
cage-birds
;
Seebohm
insisted
that
they
were
the
former
,
because
they
showed
no
evidence
of
having
been
in
captivity
,
although
the
same
might
be
said
of
most
birds
which
have
been
care-↵fully
attended
to
in
spacious
aviaries
.
Howard
Saunders
did
not
hesitate
to
regard
them
as
freed
captives
,
observing
that
"
although
cages-full
are
known
to
be
imported
,
there
are
persons
who
wish
to
believe
that
the
individuals
captured
are
not
escaped
birds
,
but
stragglers
from
a
warm
to
an
inhospitable
climate
.
"
Here
again
,
the
same
might
be
said
of
other
species
with
equal
fairness
,
yet
I
think
he
may
have
been
correct
.

The
Siskin
.
Clitysomitris

,
LiNN
.
THE
distribution
of
the
Siskin
or
Aberdevine*
extends
throughout
Europe
to
the
limit
of
conifer
growth
:
in
Africa
it
is
said
to
occur
during
severe
winters
in
Morocco
and
Algeria
;
it
is
also
found
in
Northern
Asia
,
and
across
Siberia
to
China
and
Japan
.
In
Great
Britain
during
the
summer
months
the
vSiskin
is
chiefly
confined
to
the
fir-woods
of
the
north
,
consequently
it
is
somewhat
local
in
its
distribution
;
in
some
parts
of
Scotland
and
Ireland
it
is
fairly
abundant
as
a
breeding
species
,
as
also
in
some
of
the
northern
counties
of
England
:
it
has
,
moreover
,
been
known
occasionally
to
breed
in
Surrej^
Sussex
,
and
I
am
tolerably
sure
that
it
has
bred
at
Keston
,
in
Kent
,
near
to
the
lakes
,
where
there
is
a
belt
of
tall
conifers
,
for
I
saw
a
pair
there
early
in
June
,
1886
,
and
heard
the
male
singing
its
sprightly
song
,
with
the
unmistakeable
hurdy-gurdy
finish
.
Since
1898
it
has
been
recorded
as
breeding
in
Shropshire
,
Derby
,
Yorkshire
and
probably
Suther-↵land
.
In
the
winter
the
distribution
of
the
Siskin
is
much
more
general
,
extending
into
Western
Scotland
and
the
South
of
England
.
The
adult
male
has
the
general
colouring
of
the
upper
parts
olive-green
with
darker
shaft-streaks
,
the
rump
much
more
yellow
,
showing
the
shaft-streaks
distinctly
at
the
junction
with
the
lower
part
of
the
back
;
crown
of
head
black
;
wings
black
,
the
coverts
tipped
with
yellow
,
the
flights
with
white
diffused
borders
to
the
inner
web
excepting
towards
the
tips
,
the
primaries
narrowly
margined
with
A'cllow
and
,
excepting
the
first
three
,
with
broad
yellow
bases
,
forming
a
belt
which
extends
across
the
secondaries
:
central
tail-feathers
blackish
,
the
remainder
3-ellow
,
with
black
shafts
and
broad
blackish
tips
;
a
broad
superciliary
streak
extending
from
above
the
eye
to
the
nape
;
lores
blackish
;
sides
of
face
greenish
yellow
,
more
green
on
the
ear-coverts
;
chin
black
;
throat
and
breast
bright
3'ellow
;
belly
white
,
the
flanks
sordid
yellowish
,
streaked
with
black
:
beak
horn-↵brown
,
paler
at
the
base
(
becoming
paler
and
pinker
in
confinement
)
;
feet
pale
brown
(
also
becoming
more
fleshy
in
captivity-
)
;
iris
dark
brown
.
The
female
is
slightly
smaller
and
has
a
broader
crown
than
the
male
,
she
is
altogether
duller
and
greyer
in
colouring
,
with
less
yellow
on
tlie
rump
,
wings
,
and
tail
,
and
with
the
underparts
much
more
streaked
;
she
has
also
no
black
on
the
crown
or
chin
.
The
young
are
still
duller
and
gre3'er
than
the
female
.
The
Siskin
is
a
bird
of
the
pine
woods
during
the
breeding
season
,
though
in
winter
it
wanders
aboiit
the
countr}-
in
small
or
sometimes
large
flocks
,
which
reach
the
south
of
England
in
September
,
and
are
eagerl}-
welcomed
by
the
bird-↵catchers
who
net
considerable
numbers
to
sell
as
cage-birds
.
The
Siskin
is
an
extremely
restless
bird
,
and
in
all
its
actions
reminds
one
strongl}'
of
the
Tit-mice
;
its
flight
is
rapid
but
irregular
,
like
its
song
;
but
the
latter
to
ni}-
mind
is
superior
to
that
of
any
other
British
Finch
,
in
spite
of
its
comical
finish
with
six
coupled
notes
and
a
harsh
chair
at
the
end
.
The
call-note
is
neither
gUc
,
zei^ig
nor
a
weak
tit-tit-tit-iit
;
it
is
distinctly
hootelee
,
JwoteUe
;
the
word
^f-Ar
is
doubtless
a
corruption
of
the
telee
(
which
is
all
that
the
ear
can
compass
in
the
open
,
though
in
an
aviar}-
with
sloping
roof
the
whole
sound
is
clearly
audible
)
;
the
term
cc/.v/V
probabl}'
was
given
to
this
bird
by
the
Germans
more
on
account
of
its
frivolous
nature
,
than
because
it
in
the
slightest
degree
represented
the
character
of
either
song
or
call-note
;
*
I
can
only
explain
the
quadrupled
///
,
on
the
assumption
that
a
party
of
young
Robins
happened
to
be
in
a
tree
occupied
by
Siskins
.
Mr.
R.
J.
Ussher
's
notes
on
this
species
,
which
I
quoted
in
my
"
Handbook
of
British
Oology
,
"
will
bear
repeating
here
;
he
sa3-s
:
—
"
In
April
and
]Ma3%
1857
,
Siskins
were
unusually
common
at
Cappagh
,
in
the
woods
of
fir
,
both
on
the
low
ground
and
on
the
hill-side
;
in
fact
,
the
woods
were
continuall3-
ringing
with
the
song
of
this
bird
.
Yon
might
hear
it
as
it
flew
over
the
wood
uttering
its
peculiar
cr3%
half
chirp
,
half
song
;
at
one
time
fl3'ing
straight
forward
,
as
if
to
some
destination
,
then
turning
and
making
a
circuit
,
as
if
it
did
not
know
its
own
mind
,
or
as
if
it
were
loth
to
descend
from
its
jo3-ous
flight
,
then
again
darting
oft"
in
a
new
direction
,
whilst
its
notes
would
gradually
die
awa3'
.
Its
every
tone
and
movement
is
fnll
of
auimation
and
delight
,
as
if
it
were
beside
itself
witli
pleasnre
;
this
is
particularl}'
the
case
in
the
nesting
season
,
at
which
time
I
have
seen
the
male
flying
slowly
towards
some
topmost
spray
of
a
fir-tree
,
ponring
forth
his
delightful
little
warbling
song
,
which
very
much
resembles
that
of
a
Goldfinch
,
but
is
to
my
ears
far
sweeter
.
It
vcr}-
often
sings
when
flying
,
but
more
frequently
when
perching
on
some
fir-tree
top
;
indeed
the
Siskin
in
spring
seems
more
like
a
visitor
from
a
happier
world
.
"
The
Siskin
usually
places
its
nest
high
up
,
near
the
end
of
a
lateral
branch
of
a
fir-
or
Ijirch
-tree
,
or
even
at
the
top
against
the
main
stem
;
but
the
nest
is
also
said
to
be
sometimes
built
quite
low
down
in
spruce
,
furze
,
or
juniper
bushes
,
though
Seebohm
was
inclined
to
doubt
the
correctness
of
the
records
iipon
wdiich
this
statement
is
based
,
Naumann
having
asserted
tliat
tl;c
nest
is
always
in
con-↵ifers
,
seldom
less
than
twenty-five
feet
from
the
ground
.
The
nest
itself
is
neatly
constructed
of
moss
and
rootlets
,
upon
a
slight
foundation
of
heather
and
bents
,
and
the
lining
consists
of
vegetable
down
,
horsel]airs
,
and
sometimes
a
few
feathers
.
The
eggs
number
from
five
to
six
,
and
exactly
resemble
those
of
the
Goldfinch
in
size
,
colour
,
markings
,
and
variations
:
they
are
bluish-green
,
usuallj'
pale
;
spotted
,
dotted
,
and
sometimes
streaked
with
dark
chocolate-brown
,
and
with
lilacine
gre3dsh
shell-markings
;
as
with
the
eggs
of
all
the
typical
Finches
,
they
vary
considerably
in
size
.
*
Like
all
the
true
Finches
the
hen
bird
builds
the
first
nest
and
incubates
alone
,
although
the
male
as
usual
tries
to
help
and
only
succeeds
in
hindering
;
whether
he
works
in
earnest
at
the
second
nest
I
do
not
know
:
but
,
from
his
close
relationship
to
the
Goldfinch
,
he
should
be
capable
of
doing
so
.
The
Siskin
feeds
largely
on
seeds
of
weeds
and
beech-mast
;
but
during
the
breeding
season
it
eats
a
considerable
number
of
aphides
,
and
probably
small
green
caterpillars
,
milky
,
unripe
seeds
of
groundsel
,
sow-thistle
,
and
similar
weeds
;
whilst
at
all
seasons
,
it
is
as
mischievous
as
a
Tit
in
destroying
tender
buds
.
In
captivit}'
it
eats
the
usual
seeds
,
being
especially
fond
of
hemp
and
teasel
,
also
soft
food
,
green
food
,
and
(
although
I
do
not
approve
of
such
food
)
it
is
as
fond
as
the
Goldfinch
and
the
whole
of
the
Tits
of
picking
a
bone
,
clinging
to
it
in
all
positions
,
and
behaving
in
every
respect
exactly
like
a
Tit
.
The
Siskin
is
one
of
the
most
charming
of
all
aviary
birds
,
on
account
of
its
wonderfull}'
confiding
nature
.
I
turned
a
pair
which
I
purchased
in
November
,
1889
,
about
three
weeks
after
their
capture
,
into
a
large
aviar}'
;
and
,
in
three
daj-s
,
they
had
so
thoroughl}-
learned
to
trust
me
,
that
they
flew
into
my
hand
and
disputed
over
poppy-seed
and
egg
;
one
of
these
birds
lived
fox-
three
years
,
and
would
even
permit
me
to
raise
my
hand
until
my
nose
touched
her
beak
,
when
she
would
fl}'
off
to
a
twig
,
aud
return
directl}'
I
held
my
hand
out
to
her
again
;
there
were
two
hens
and
a
cock
in
this
trio
,
and
the
male
outlived
both
of
his
wives
;
finall}-
he
appeared
to
have
acquired
a
growth
in
his
throat
,
which
obstructed
his
breathing
;
there-↵fore
as
my
experience
of
doctoring
birds
is
,
that
in
nineteen
out
of
twenty
cases
it
kills
them
within
ten
minutes
,
I
thought
I
would
give
my
Siskin
the
oppor-↵tunity
of
doctoring
himself
;
so
I
turned
him
loose
in
my
garden
,
where
he
remained
for
about
an
hour
,
and
then
flew
straight
awa_v
.
I
have
had
man^-
other
Siskins
at
various
times
,
sometimes
three
or
four
pairs
together
;
they
have
alwaj'S
become
very
tame
in
a
snrprisingh'
short
period
,
and
have
been
altogether
delightful
pets
;
but
most
of
them
have
died
within
a
few
months
.
Siskins
do
not
seem
to
have
anything
like
the
constitution
of
most
Goldfinches
.
One
tame
little
hen
bird
,
however
,
lived
to
a
good
age
;
and
,
when
she
had
lost
three
husbands
in
succession
,
I
caged
her
and
made
a
regular
pet
of
her
.
After
six
months
I
wearied
of
the
extra
labour
(
every
separate
cage
adding
to
the
time
occupied
in
providing
for
m}'
large
family
)
;
I
,
therefore
,
turned
Cissie
,
as
I
called
her
,
into
one
of
my
bird-room
aviaries
;
but
she
had
forgotten
all
about
libert}^
flew
wildly
against
the
wires
in
the
greatest
terror
,
and
presentl}'
settled
down
in
a
corner
with
her
face
to
the
wall
;
having
evidently
decided
thas
life
was
no
longer
worth
having
:
I
,
therefore
,
picked
her
up
and
restored
her
to
her
cage
,
where
she
sat
looking
stupid
for
half-an-hour
before
she
recovered
.
I
subsequently
gave
this
bird
to
a
3'oung
lady
,
who
christened
her
Priscilla
,
and
made
much
of
her
to
the
day
of
her
death
about
a
year
later
.

CdJ-LucIis

DR

SHARPE
states
that
this
bird
iuhabits
Europe
generally
,
except
the
extreme
north
;
the
Canar}-
Islands
,
Madeira
,
and
the
countries
bordering
the
Mediterranean
:
it
is
a
winter
visitant
to
Eg3'pt
and
Palestine
.
In
Siberia
it
extends
to
Omsk
and
Krasuo3-arsk
,
and
winters
in
Turkestan
.
In
Great
Britain
the
Goldfinch
is
pretty
generally
distributed
throughout
England
,
and
in
suitable
localites
in
Scotland
and
Ireland
,
though
the
wholesale
destruction
of
woods
,
plantations
and
so-called
waste
land
has
rendered
the
species
comparatively
rare
and
local
in
man}-
parts
of
Great
Britain
.
In
the
north
of
Kent
,
where
the
nest
might
be
obtained
fairly
commonly
,
year
after
year
,
about
thirty-five
years
ago
,
it
is
now
hardly
ever
met
with
,
excepting
perhaps
in
strictly
private
gardens
,
pleasure-grounds
,
and
orchards
:
indeed
,
I
believe
it
is
fully
twenty-three
years
since
I
last
saw
a
wild
Kentish
Goldfinch
in
the
summer-↵time
.
This
is
the
most
beautiful
of
our
British
Finches
:
the
adult
male
has
the
forehead
broadly
satinj'
-crimson
,
extending
at
the
sides
as
a
superciliary
streak
which
sometimes
passes
behind
the
eye
and
unites
with
a
broad
patch
of
the
same
colour
on
the
front
of
the
face
below
the
lores
,
and
on
the
throat
;
the
lores
,
feathers
at
base
of
beak
and
chin
black
:
crown
and
feathers
behind
the
cheeks
black
;
cheeks
snow-white
(
slightly
stained
in
the
centre
with
buffish-brown
,
especially
in
young
birds
)
continuous
with
a
white
belt
encircling
the
back
of
the
throat
:
back
greyish
copper-brown
,
with
a
transverse
white
spot
on
the
nape
;
wings
blue-↵black
,
occasionally
slightly
glossed
wdth
Prussian-green
ou
the
lesser
coverts
;
greater
coverts
golden-yellow
;
the
basal
two-thirds
of
the
primaries
,
excepting
the
first
,
with
the
outer
webs
bright
golden-yellow
,
the
secondaries
also
with
broad
yellow
bases
,
so
that
the
wing
appears
to
be
broadly
belted
with
yellow
;
inner
primaries
and
outer
secondaries
tipped
with
white
,
inner
secondaries
with
buffish-↵brown
;
upper
tail-coverts
whitish
,
washed
with
buffish-brown
,
in
Continental
birds
sometimes
white
,
varied
with
sienna
or
reddish-buff
;
tail
feathers
blue-black
,
the
central
ones
tipped
wnili
white
,
the
two
outer
ones
with
a
large
oval
white
patch
on
the
inner
web
;
under
parts
niostl}'
white
;
a
band
across
tlie
fore-chest
,
the
sides
of
breast
,
and
tlie
flanks
bright
fawn-coloured
;
under
tail-coverts
washed
witli
l)iiffish
;
beak
pinkish-white
,
with
the
terminal
half
of
the
upper
mandible
and
tip
of
the
lower
mandible
dark
horu-browu
;
feet
flesh-brown
;
iris
hazel
.
In
confinement
the
beak
and
feet
become
paler
and
more
pink
in
tint
.
The
female
is
nsuall}'
.slightly
smaller
than
the
male
,
has
a
narrower
crown
,
and
a
much
narrower
,
straighter
,
and
more
regularly
tapering
beak
;
the
crimson
on
the
head
rarely
extends
quite
so
fi^r
backward
on
the
forehead
and
throat
;
the
checks
are
much
more
stained
with
buff-brownish
;
the
lesser
coverts
are
distinctl}'
browner
;
the
yellow
on
the
wing
is
rarely
so
brilliant
;
upper
tail
coverts
less
white
,
more
mouse-brown
,
sometimes
wholly
of
that
colour
;
and
the
under
parts
are
not
quite
so
pure
a
white
,
showing
a
suspicion
of
grey
when
compared
with
the
male
.
Young
birds
,
known
to
bird-catchers
as
"
Gre3'
-pates
,
"
show
no
black
or
crimson
on
the
head
,
have
huffish
tips
to
the
wing-feathers
,
and
brownish
underparts
,
with
indistinct
spotting
on
the
breast
.
The
general
characteristics
of
the
adult
birds
are
acquired
after
the
first
moult
,
but
the
full
beauty
of
the
species
is
not
brought
out
until
after
its
second
moult
.
Birdcatchers
always
distinguish
the
sex
of
the
Goldfinch
by
"
the
colour
of
the
shoulder
,
"
intense
black
in
the
male
,
rusty
black
in
the
female
:
this
,
however
,
is
not
so
eas}-
to
note
in
j-oung
birds
as
is
the
diff"erent
outline
of
the
beak
when
seen
from
above
,
or
the
greater
arch
of
the
culmen
in
the
male
beak
when
seen
from
the
side
.
The
width
of
the
yellow
belt
across
the
secondaries
is
even
more
easy
to
note*
.
Although
the
Goldfinch
does
not
haunt
the
interior
of
thick
woods
,
it
frequently
hangs
about
the
more
open
spaces
on
their
outskirts
,
especially
where
rank
weeds
such
as
thistles
,
teasels
,
or
plantains
abound
,
upon
the
seed
of
which
it
delights
to
feed
;
but
orchards
,
shrubberies
,
gardens
,
and
waste
patches
on
badly
cultivated
ground
are
its
favourite
resorts
in
the
summer
time
;
whilst
in
the
winter
it
wanders
throughout
the
country
in
small
or
large
flocks
seeking
for
food
.
A
considerable
number
of
Goldfinches
,
nevertheless
,
joins
the
stream
of
migrants
to-↵wards
the
south
in
the
autumn
months
.
The
Goldfinch
is
certainly
much
rarer
in
our
islands
than
it
former!}'
was
,
but
I
can
not
think
even
Mr.
Swaysland
's
statement
—
that
at
one
time
a
boy
could
catch
forty
dozen
in
a
morning
,
or
the
undoubted
fact
that
birdcatchers
would
rejoice
if
they
could
do
so
now
,
will
at
all
account
for
the
great
diminution
in
their
numbers
;
the
continual
reckless
destruction
of
all
kinds
of
birds
of
prey
would
probably
counterbalance
the
numbers
obtained
bN'
'catchers
,
who
onl}-
capture
sufficient
to
supplj-
the
bird
-market
,
whereas
the
IVIerliii
,
Sparrow-Hawk
,
Hen-↵Harrier
,
and
most
of
the
Owls
,
which
are
more
or
less
destructive
to
small
birds
,
pay
no
attention
to
close-seasons
,
but
destroy
throughoitt
the
year
.
On
several
occasions
bird-catchers
have
brought
me
Sparrow-Hawks
which
have
swooped
at
the
decoy-Goldfinch
and
been
caught
in
the
nets
.
The
nest
of
the
Goldfinch
is
most
frequentl_y
to
be
found
in
orchards
,
prefer-↵abl}'
on
the
lichen-covered
branch
of
an
old
apple-tree
,
though
it
also
occurs
at
times
in
the
branches
of
a
pear
,
horse-chestnut
,
beech
,
plane
,
poplar
,
yew
,
cypress
,
laurel
,
or
even
in
a
deciduous
shrub
:
in
Norfolk
I
took
it
from
near
the
top
of
a
tall
hawthorn
hedge
.
Usuall}^
the
nest
,
which
is
small
and
cup-shaped
,
is
neatly
formed
of
moss
and
lichen
,
interwoven
with
rootlets
and
wool
;
it
is
lined
with
thistle-down
,
small
soft
feathers
,
and
horse-hair
:
my
Norfolk
nest
,
however
,
is
without
the
lichens
,
and
is
chiefly
lined
with
some
W00II3'
substance
,
probably
vegetable
,
but
hardly
white
enough
for
thistle-down
:
the
eggs
in
this
nest
are
also
unusually
small
.
The
late
Rev
.
H.
A.
Macpherson
wrote
:
—
"
The
most
curious
nest
of
the
Gold-↵finch
that
I
ever
saw
was
built
entirel_v
of
stems
of
dr}-
grass
.
It
contained
a
full
complement
of
tiny
Goldfinches
,
and
was
l)uilt
in
a
plum-tree
.
"
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
five
,
usually
the
latter
,
and
are
similar
to
those
of
a
Linnet
,
but
usually
rather
smaller
;
they
are
greenish- white
,
spotted
and
streaked
,
especiall}'
at
the
larger
end
,
with
purplish-brown
,
and
with
lilacine-↵grey
shell-spots
;
the3%
however
,
vary
greatly
from
this
type
,
some
eggs
being
merely
speckled
and
spotted
with
dull
blood- red
,
whilst
others
are
almost
without
markings
.
The
song
of
the
Goldfinch
is
much
over-rated
;
it
is
cheerful
,
but
scrappy
in
character
;
the
hen
sometimes
sings
quite
as
well
as
the
cock
,
and
the
song
is
the
same
:
some
years
ago
I
carefully
noted
the
whole
performance
,
going
over
it
again
and
again
,
with
the
bird
singing
close
to
me
,
until
I
had
it
all
down
exactly
as
follows
:
—
l]l/ci-c-ur
,
whec-c-ur
,
whtc-c-nr
,
too-00-cc
,
li-iveea
,
ii-ivcca
,
wliihvcea
,
cliiwliit
,
c/iiivit
,
clira'it
;
whetc, ivhctc
,
wlitcc
.
The
last
three
notes
are
accompanied
b}^
violent
lateral
jerks
of
the
tail
and
a
corresponding
movement
of
the
bod}-
,
which
some-↵times
almost
upsets
the
bird
's
balance
.
The
call-note
beai"s
some
resemblance
to
that
of
the
Canary
;
but
the
scolding
note
,
or
note
of
defiance
,
is
a
sharp
shrill
(■////
,
sometimes
continued
into
a
chittcyi
-tit
,
tit
:
as
the
Goldfinch
is
tolerabl}'
quarrelsome
,
this
note
,
which
somewhat
reminds
one
of
a
common
autumnal
utterance
of
the
Robin
,
is
frequeuth'
heard
.
The
food
consists
largely
of
seeds
,
buds
,
and
the
leaves
and
flower-heads
of
weeds
,
especially
groundsel
;
but
when
rearing
their
3'oung
the
old
birds
also
feed
to
a
great
cxteut
upon
aphides
aud
small
green
caterpillars
:
in
confiueinent
soft-↵food
answers
the
same
purpose
.
As
a
cage
and
aviar^y
bird
the
Goldfinch
is
a
general
favourite
;
some
avicnl-↵turists
admiring
it
(
most
unaccountably
)
for
its
energetic
,
though
absurd
song
,
others
for
muling
purposes
,
others
again
for
its
lovely
plumage
,
and
a
few
on
account
of
its
capacity
for
learning
the
usual
stupid
tricks
"
violating
the
laws
of
nature
,
"
as
the
editor
of
the
4th
edition
of
Yarrell
most
aptly
observes
.
As
a
cage-bird
the
Goldfinch
is
too
restless
to
be
pleasing
;
he
is
on
the
front
wires
half
his
time
,
and
keeps
jumping
backwards
aud
forwards
from
perch
to
wires
almost
incessanth^
vainly
repeating
a
fragment
of
his
song
—
''
c/iiivif
,
ihh^'it
,
c/iiiviiy
In
an
aviary
everything
is
altered
:
he
darts
hither
and
thither
with
undulating
flight
,
poises
on
the
top
of
,
or
hangs
underneath
a
twig
,
or
the
extremity
of
a
spra}'
of
fir
,
picking
out
buds
or
leaves
;
he
squabbles
with
his
brothers
in
the
bath
or
the
seed-pan
,
fights
furiously
for
possession
of
a
wife
,
and
,
having
secured
her
,
wages
incessant
warfare
with
all
who
dai^e
approach
her
.
For
a
nesting-site
he
chooses
a
Hartz-cage
hanging
high
upon
the
back
of
the
aviar}^
,
assists
his
wife
with
her
first
nest
,
and
builds
a
second
in
another
cage
whilst
the
young
are
still
under
her
care
;
such
at
any
rate
was
my
experience
in
1895
:
four
young
were
hatched
in
my
first
nest
,
of
which
three
flew
and
were
brought
up
,
being
fed
as
usual
from
the
crop
,
upon
partly
digested
seed
and
the
soft
food
prepared
for
my
insectivorous
birds
.
After
leaving
the
nest
the
mother-bird
ceased
to
trouble
about
her
j-oung
,
but
began
to
lay
in
the
second
nest
almost
immediatel}'
;
the
male
bird
now
having
to
undertake
the
double
duty
of
feeding
his
first
family
and
his
wife
.
About
thirteen
days
later
five
3'oung
were
hatched
,
and
but
for
the
playfulness
of
the
first
family
would
doubtless
have
been
reared
;
but
the
j-oung
ruffians
pulled
them
all
out
on
the
sand
and
left
them
there
.
Shortly
afterwards
the
hen
put
a
fresh
lining
into
her
first
nest
and
sat
again
upon
a
clutch
of
six
eggs
,
all
of
which
she
hatched
;
unhappily
all
these
,
excepting
the
last
one
,
which
I
put
under
a
Canary
,
shared
the
fate
of
their
predecessors
:
even
the
sixth
bird
was
pkicked
to
death
by
its
foster-mother
.
In
1896
my
Goldfinches
again
built
,
quarrelling
for
bits
of
wadding
,
robbing
one
anothers
'
nests
,
changing
their
minds
as
to
the
site
of
a
nest
,
and
pulling
the
latter
to
pieces
when
completed
;
eventually
one
hen
laid
two
or
three
eggs
in
a
Canar^^'s
nest
,
and
the
two
mothers
were
so
constantly
disputing
that
,
although
the
j-oung
were
hatched
,
none
were
reared
.
After
the
autumn
moult
one
of
the
birds
produced
a
golden
instead
of
a
crimson
colour
on
the
face
;
but
the
Rev
.
H.
A.
Macpherson
told
me
that
this
was
of
common
occurrence
in
captivit}'
.
I
always
purchase
my
Goldfinches
as
"
Grey-pates
"
;
and
as
they
have
plenty
of
exercise
and
abundance
of
nourishing
food
,
ruy
birds
when
adult
are
frequently
mistaken
by
breeders
for
"
Russians
"
;
when
first
turned
out
they
always
have
plenty
of
hemp
and
teasel
,
with
groundsel
and
chickweed
;
and
there
is
usually
a
saucer
of
soft-food
in
the
aviary
:
the
colours
of
the
male
birds
are
wonderfully
pure
and
brilliant
,
and
the
birds
themselves
are
large
and
well-formed
.
Mule-breeding
between
Goldfinch
and
Canary
is
easy
enough
,
for
I
was
successful
in
my
first
essay
;
but
between
the
Goldfinch
and
other
Finches
,
there
is
more
difficulty
(
although
this
species
sometimes
hybridizes
with
the
Greenfinch
in
a
wild
state
)
especially
in
the
case
of
the
only
reality
handsome
cross
—
between
the
Goldfinch
and
Bullfinch
.
The
variety
of
Goldfinch
known
as
a
"
Cheverel
"
is
sometimes
preferred
for
muling
purposes
;
it
diifers
from
the
normal
form
in
having
the
centre
of
the
throat
white
.
The
bird-catchers
assert
that
Goldfinches
from
different
parts
of
our
islands
sing
differently
;
and
they
call
the
best
singers
"
Slammers
,
"
from
a
fancied
resemblance
of
part
of
the
song
to
the
words
—
"
Slam-so-witty
,
slippity-cur
,
"
with
other
rubbish
which
no
bird
could
whistle

Howard

,
on

unites
A.

and
A.

,
remarking
:
—
"
for
the
sake
of
convenience
,
I
propose
to
treat
the
Mealy

under
one
heading
,
and
to
take
our
small
,
dark
Lesser

separatel}-
.
"
As
this
appears
to
me
to
be
the
most
reasonable
course
to
pursue
,
I
shall
do
the
same
.
Dr.
Sharpe
regards
the
Lesser
Redpoll
(
.1
.
n/fi-sciiis
)
as
a
subspecies
of
A.
liiiaria
,
but
distinguishes
.7
.
hoi iiema)i):i
as
a
subspecies
of
A.
exiiipe^
,
the
latter
being
considered
a
different
species
from
the
Mealy
Redpoll
,
on
account
of
its
greyer
rump
.
When
no
two
Ornithologists
agree
as
to
the
limits
of
various
closelj'
-related
t3-pes
,
the
evidence
in
favour
of
these
all
belonging
to
one
species
would
seem
to
be
very
strong
indeed
.
Nevertheless
,
as
regards
Great
Britain
,
the
two
Redpolls
usuall^^
met
with
are
sufliciently
distinct
to
be
separately
treated
.
Dr.
Sharpe
gives
the
distribution
of
our
Mealy
Redpoll
as
:
—
"
Northern
Europe
,
across
Siberia
to
North
America
,
wintering
in
more
southern
localities
.
"
To
Great
Britain
this
bird
is
a
more
or
less
irregular
winter
visitor
;
Howard
Saunders
states
that
it
"
is
a
regular
winter
visitor
to
Shetland
,
from
September
onwards
,
and
the
track
of
its
migration
appears
to
be
principall}'
along
the
east
coast
in
Scotland
,
and
the
north
of
England
,
for
the
bird
is
rarer
,
and
of
more
uncertain
occurrence
on
the
west
side
.
South
of
Durham
its
visits
become
irregular
;
in
the
eastern
counties
it
has
occasionally
been
obtained
in
spring
,
and
exceptionally
in
summer
;
and
in
some
years
large
flocks
have
been
noticed
down
to
the
Channel
;
but
in
Cornwall
it
is
as
yet
unknown
.
In

an

The
male
Mealy
Redpoll
in
breeding-plumage
has
the
upper
parts
pale
brown
,
lighter
on
the
back
and

of
neck
,
and
streaked
with
blackish-brown
;
the

crimson
;
the
rump
greyish

,
suffused
with
rose-pink
;
wings
dull
blackish
;
median
and
greater
coverts
with
pale
brown

and
wdiitish

;
the
quills
and
primary
coverts
with

edges
and
narrower
tips
;
tail
dark
brown
,
with
paler
edges
to
the
feathers
,
the
inner
webs
margined
with
white
;
base
of

and
lores
black
;
a
superciliary
streak
and
a
short
streak
below
the
eye
whitish
;

of
face
pale
brown
,
the
cheeks
slightly
rosy
;
chin
black
;
throat
and
breast
rose-pink
;
remainder
of
under
parts
bufEsh
-white
,
becoming
quite
white
on
the
under
tail-coverts
;
flanks
streaked
with
blackish-brown
;
beak
3-ellowish
horn-colour
,
darker
at
the
tip
and
more
yellow
at
the
base
;
feet
dark
brown
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
is
slightly
smaller
than
the
male
,
and
has
a
rather
broader
crown
;
*
she
is
also
darker
above
,
more
prominentl}'
streaked
below
,
and
wants
the
rose-↵colouring
on
the
rump
,
the
tliroat
,
and
breast
.
The
youug
chiefly
differ
from
the
female
in
the
lack
of
crimson
on
the
forehead
,
and
in
the
more
sand}'
colouring
of
the
upper
parts
.
In
confinement
,
the
crimson
and
ros}'
colouring
entirely
disappears
after
the
first
moult
,
excepting
in
large
and
well
ventilated
aviaries
,
when
it
is
sometimes
partially
retained
:
this
statement
also
applies
to
the
Lesser
Redpoll
,
the
Twite
,
and
the
Linnet
.
In
its
habits
,
this
and
all
the
Redpolls
are
much
alike
,
restless
,
fidgety
little
creatures
,
Tit-like
in
their
actions
,
inquisitive
,
and
mischievous
;
but
intelligent
,
and
,
therefore
,
easy
to
teach
all
kinds
of
meaningless
tricks
:
principally
on
account
of
the
last
qualification
they
have
become
favourite
cage-birds
with
that
class
of
persons
which
is
charmed
with
what
is
unnatural
.
To
the
true
lover
of
nature
a
talking
bird
may
be
amusing
,
because
it
is
the
nature
of
many
birds
to
imitate
sounds
;
but
a
performing
bird
is
offensive
.
Seebohm
(
Hist
.
British
Birds
,
Vol
.
II
,
pp
.
118-
119
)
has
some
interesting
observations
on
the
habits
of
this
species
,
both
abroad
and
in
this
country
,
which
are
worth
noting
.
He
says
that
in
winter
they
are
principally
ground-feeders
,
which
we
should
have
expected
to
be
the
case
from
what
we
know
of
Linnets
and
Goldfinches
;
like
which
birds
they
"
alight
in
a
flock
on
a
bed
of
dead
thistles
,
"
and
amuse
themselves
by
picking
them
to
pieces
.
He
also
records
the
fact
of
their
picking
seeds
from
the
droppings
of
horses
on
the
roads
;
which
is
instructive
,
as
showing
that
they
look
upon
oats
and
kindred
grain
as
wholesome
food
;
a
fact
which
aviculture
taught
me
many
years
ago
.
The
nest
of
the
Mealy
Redpoll
is
usually
placed
in
the
fork
of
a
birch-tree
at
no
great
height
from
the
ground
,
it
has
also
been
found
in
grass-tussocks
;
it
is
neatly
constructed
of
twigs
,
bents
,
strips
of
bark
,
and
lichens
,
or
moss
;
the
lining
of
willow-catkins
,
vegetable-down
,
hair
,
wool
,
and
sometimes
feathers
.
The
eggs
number
from
five
to
six
,
and
vary
in
colour
from
pale
greenish
to
pale
bluish
,
with
dark
brown
surface-spots
,
and
paler
red-brown
underlying
markings
.
Although
there
is
no
satisfactory
evidence
to
prove
that
the
Mealy
Redpoll
has
ever
bred
in
Great
Britain
,
a
male
in
breeding-plumage
was
observed
at
Riddlesworth
,
in
July
,
1848
,
and
noticed
by
Prof.
Alfred
Newton
in
the
"
Zoologist
"
(
^p
.
2382
)
;
still
this
bird
may
possibly
have
escaped
from
an
out-door
aviary
after
a
few
months
confinement
.
The
song
of
this
species
,
if
such
it
can
be
called
,
is
merely
a
prolonged
trill
,
such
as
may
be
imitated
either
by
vibrating
the
soft
palate
as
you
whistle
.
or
by
using
a
pea-whistle
,
and
the
call-note
somewhat
resembles
that
of
a
Canar\'
,
a
kind
of
tnvcy
.
The
favourite
food
consists
of
seed
of
the
birch
,
but
many
other
seeds
are
eaten
,
and
in
confinement
the
same
food
is
eaten
by
the
Redpolls
as
by
the
Canary
;
the
most
wholesome
seeds
being
Canary
,
German
rape
,
and
oats
.
Curiously
enough
,
aviculturists
do
not
appear
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
most
seed-eating
birds
are
fond
of
the
last-mentioned
wholesome
and
cheap
seed
,
and
they
quite
laugh
at
the
mere
idea
of
offering
oats
to
small
birds
,
imagining
that
,
because
the
seed
is
large
,
it
is
only
suitable
for
Cardinals
or
other
large
birds
:
this
is
a
curious
mistake
.
In
addition
to
the
above
,
grass-seed
,
thistle
,
and
teasel
,
are
good
for
a
change
,
especially
during
the
breeding
and
moulting
seasons
.
Not
being
particularly
fond
of
Redpolls
in
an
aviary
,
I
have
never
purchased
the
jMealy
race
;
but
Henry
Stevenson
in
his
"
Birds
of
Norfolk
"
(
p.
229
)
sa3-s
:
—
"
Both
the
Mealy
and
Lesser
Redpolls
,
from
their
tameness
and
engaging
actions
,
are
most
desirable
additions
to
the
cage
or
aviary
,
but
iVom
their
happy
contented
natures
are
liable
to
grow
too
fat
,
and
like
Ortolans
,
when
over-fed
,
drop
off
the
perch
in
a
fit
of
apoplex}'
.
Mr.
Charles
Barnard
,
of
this
city
,
before
mentioned
as
so
successful
in
breeding
the
Bramblings
in
confinement
,
had
a
brood
of
j-oung
Mealy
Redpolls
,
hatched
off
in
his
aviary
at
vStoke
,
in
July
,
i860
,
a
very
uncommon
circumstance
with
this
species
.
"
Of
late
years
the
judges
at
some
of
our
large
shows
have
been
very
unwilling
to
award
prizes
,
in
the
British
classes
,
to
birds
which
do
not
breed
with
us
;
asserting
,
in
support
of
their
action
,
that
most
of
these
birds
have
not
even
been
captured
upon
British
soil
;
but
have
been
imported
as
cage-birds
direct
from
Germany
.
Singularl}'
enough
,
they
invariably
waive
this
objection
in
the
case
of
the
Mealy
Redpoll
,
which
(
though
it
may
be
in
wild
breeding-plumage
,
and
by
no
means
tame
)
usually
carries
off
the
prizes
over
the
heads
of
the
more
soberly
clad
though
home-bred
Lesser
Redpoll
.
Such
inconsistency
can
only
be
explained
on
the
supposition
that
the
life-history
of
the
Mealy
Redpoll
has
not
been
so
inti-↵mately
studied
as
it
ought
to
be
by
those
who
have
to
deal
with
it
upon
the
show-bench
.
As
Gatke
observes
:
—
"
The
breeding
stations
of
the
Mealy
Redpoll
lie
within
the
Arctic
Circle
,
both
in
the
Old
and
New
World
.
"
Speaking
of
the
migration
of
this
species
,
the
same
author
says
that
on
the
4tli
and
5tli
November
,
1847
,
"
countless
flocks
"
and
"innumerable
multitudes
"
visited
Heligoland
:
—
"
the
whole
island
was
literally
co\-ered
with
these
birds
,
so
that
one
might
have
thrown
a
stone
in
any
direction
one
chose
,
and
it
was
sure
to
hit
birds
as
long
as
it
con-↵tinued
rolling
along
the
ground
.
"
It
is
during
such
unusual
manifestations
of
feathered
life
,
that
the
bird-catcher
gathers
iu
his
harvest
,
and
the
markets
are
gdutted
throughout
Europe

without
rose-red
colouration
;
the
under
parts
also
somewhat
more
streaked
than
in
the
uuile
.
The
^-oung
ncarl_v
resemble
the
female
,
but
have
no
red
on
the
crown
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
rose-colouring
disappears
,
but
towards
the
spring
it
gradually
reappears
iu
the
feathers
without
a
moult
:
this
reproduction
of
bright
colouring
does
not
,
however
,
take
place
in
caged
Redpolls
,
but
,
where
the}'
are
confined
in
large
well-ventilated
sunny
aviaries
,
it
does
iu
the
first
season
.
In
its
habits
,
haunts
,
food
,
and
song
,
the
Lesser
Redpoll
nearly
resembles
the
Meal}'
type
:
its
nest
,
which
is
placed
in
the
fork
of
a
tree
,
a
hawthorn
,
or
gooseberry
bush
,
a
hedge
,
or
a
large
grass
tussock
,
usually
near
water
,
is
not
unlike
a
small
,
neatl}'
formed
,
and
very
softly
lined
Linnet
's
nest
;
it
is
firmly
constructed
of
plant-stalks
,
roots
,
moss
,
and
drj'
-grass
,
with
hair
towards
the
interior
;
the
lining
consisting
of
pure
white
willow-down
,
wool
or
occasionally
very
fine
grasses
and
feathers
.
The
eggs
,
which
number
from
four
to
six
,
are
either
pale
blue
,
or
bluish-white
,
with
dark
purplish-brown
surface
spots
,
and
sometimes
short
linear
dashes
and
underlying
blood-red
spots
and
speckles
;
some
eggs
are
spotted
nearly'
all
over
,
and
others
principally
at
the
larger
end
,
an
imperfect
zone
of
spots
is
often
present
at
this
extremity
:
there
is
considerable
variation
iu
size
.
I
have
not
only
seen
and
heard
the
Lesser
Redpoll
in
Kent
during
the
breeding
season
,
but
have
on
several
occasions
flushed
the
hen
bird
from
her
nest
;
twice
I
obtained
the
nest
with
six
eggs
from
grass-tussocks
growing
upon
narrow
foot-↵paths
through
marsh
and
pools
of
water
,
at
Alurston
,
*
and
once
from
a
hawthorn
bush
on
marshy
land
,
at
Kemsley
;
the
last-mentioned
nest
was
less
firm
than
usual
,
though
compact
,
the
body
of
it
being
formed
almost
entireh'
of
wool
,
with
an
outer
thin
framework
of
dried
grass
and
an
inner
lining
of
f
Lord
Lilford
(

observes
:
—
"
About
Lilford
these
birds
appear
occasionally
in
flocks
of
from
Iwenty
to
fifty
or
sixty
,
almost
always
in
very
severe
weather
,
and
then
haunt
the
alders
by
the
river-sides
,
their
habits
and
manner
of
feeding
at
that
season
much
resembling
those
of
the
Siskin
as
above
described
.
Tliey
are
exceedingly
tame
,
and
may
be
very
closely
watched
as
tliey
cluster
like
bees
on
some
hanging
sprays
,
searching
for
buds
,
and
keeping
up
an
incessant
twittering
music
,
pleasant
enough
,
but
not
by
any
means
so
melodious
as
that
of
the
Siskin
.

Speaking
of
the
nesting
of
the
Lesser
Redpoll
in
various
parts
of
Norfolk
,
Henry
Stevenson
says
:
—
"
In
these
localities
,
the
nests
have
been
mostly
found
in
the
apple
and
clierr}-
trees
,
but
Mr.
Alfred
Newton
in
a
communication
to
r^Ir
.
Hewitson
(

)
remarks
that
near
Thetford
,
where
it
also
breeds
yearly
,
the
nests
are
placed
'
close
to
the
trunk
of
the
tree
in
plantations
of
young
larch
and
firs
of
no
great
height
,
'
though
he
once
found
one
at
least
sixt}'
feet
from
the

,
and
placed
near
the
outer
end
of
a
branch

Birds

Donegal
,
"
(

)
H.
C.
Hart
says
of
Lesser
Redpolls
:
—
"
I
have
noted
them
in
IVIay
settling
themselves
about
Glenalla
in
small
flocks
,
and
scattering
to
breed
.
About
Rathmullan
and
Carra-↵blagh
they
are
also
frequent
in
summer
.
In
winter
these
birds
come
to
roost
,
with
several
other
species
,
every
night
in
the
plantations
round
ni}-
house
at
Carrablagh
,
where
there
is
the
best
shelter
for
several
miles
.
'
Very
common
about
Killybegs
in
the
breeding
season
.
Have
known
four
nests
in
the
hedge-↵rows
along
the
first
mile
of
the
Donegal
road
from
here
,
in
the
same
season
.
'

"
Speaking
of
the
species
as
observed
by
him
in
Wales
,
E.
A.
Swainson
,
of
Brecon
,
says
:
—
"
I
have
noticed
it
every
summer
here
for
some
years
,
but
this
season
(
1891
)
it
has
been
unusually
common
,
and
I
have
often
heard
its
musical
little
trill
and
triple
flight-note
about
the
alder
swamps
and
adjacent
hedges
.
In
June
last
I
found
two
nests
of
this
bird
,
placed
in
honeysuckle
growing
in
tall
hedges
,
each
containing
fresh
eggs
.
Both
nests
had
the
usual
lining
of
white
down
,
but
one
was
peculiar
in
having
a
quantit}'
of
honeysuckle
bark-strips
inter-↵woven
amongst
the
grass
round
the
outside
of
the
nest
.
This
beautiful
little
nest
contained
four
eggs
,
of
a
bright
blue-green
,
blotched
,
two
of
them
very
boldly
,
with
reddish-brown
.
"
As
a
cage-bird
the
Lesser
Redpoll
is
usually
a
great
favourite
,
chiefly
on
account
of
its
tameness
and
a
certain
amount
of
reasoning
capacity
which
it
possesses
,
whereby
it
has
discovered
,
under
the
pressure
of
hunger
and
thirst
,
that
it
can
pull
up
with
its
beak
and
hold
with
its
claw
little
pails
or
waggons
con-↵taining
its
food
or
w-ater
:
it
is
by
no
means
the
only
bird
which
has
been
taught
this
senseless
trick
,
but
many
thoughtless
bird-lovers
seem
to
consider
that
all
captives
(
even
birds
)
ought
to
be
compelled
to
work
for
their
living
.
I
have
seen
the
process
of
teaching
this
bird
in
all
its
stages
,
and
consider
it
anything
but
kind
.
The
Lesser
Redpoll
iu
coufiuemeut
is
for
ever
fidgeting
about
on
the
wirework
of
its
cage
,
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
a
Tit
:
during
the
breeding
season
the
male
and
female
spend
half
the
day
in
caressing
like
a
pair
of
Love-birds
;
whilst
the
song
of
the
male
at
that
season
is
frequent
,
but
is
a
ver}^
poor
performance
,
not
unlike
a
feeble
Brambliug
's
song
,
consisting
(
as
already
hinted
)
of
a
mere
monotonous
trill
,
resembling
a
distant
railwaj'
-guard
's
whistle
:
this
trill
is
some-↵times
copied
by
young
Canaries
,
and
is
considered
ruination
to
their
notes
.
M}-
experience
of
this
species
in
an
aviary
is
that
no
Finch
of
its
size
is
so
mischievously
meddlesome
as
the
Lesser
Redpoll
;
not
onl}'
does
it
rarely
breed
,
but
if
another
bird
which
happens
to
be
building
,
leaves
its
nest
for
fresh
material
,
the
Redpoll
immediately
flies
down
and
commences
to
pull
it
to
pieces
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Mr.
G.
C.
Swailes
,
of
Beverle3%
has
been
rather
succesful
in
breeding
Redpolls
.
The
first
Redpolls
I
ever
had
,
cost
me
about
three
shillings
for
the
pair
;
but
I
soon
discovered
that
I
had
paid
at
least
three
times
their
value
,
inasmuch
as
the
price
asked
b_y
bird-catchers
for
equally
good
birds
varied
at
that
time
from
eight-↵pence
to
a
shilling
the
pair
:
altogether
I
have
had
a
good
man}'
,
and
yet
never
cared
much
for
them
:
it
is
true
that
they
very
soon
grow
tame
,
although
never
so
completely
so
as
Siskins
;
but
after
their
first
moult
iu
close
confinement
all
the
crimson
and
rose
colouring
disappears
and
never
returns
,
the
forehead
becoming
3'ellowish
;
and
even
in
an
aviary
it
goes
after
their
second
moult
,
so
that
a
ver}-
soberly
clad
,
restless
,
inquisitive
little
bird
,
with
no
proper
song
,
but
a
large
appetite
,
is
all
that
remains
.
Herr
Gatke
's
account
of
a
pair
of
Redpolls
which
nested
in
his
garden
in
Heligoland
is
rather
puzzling
:
he
speaks
of
only
discovering
the
nest
in
the
autumn
when
the
leaves
were
falling
,
yet
is
sure
of
the
identit}^
of
the
species
from
the
fact
that
on
one
occasion
he
picked
up
two
of
the
young
birds
,
and
restored
them
to
their
home
amongst
the
elder
branches
.
Can
the
Redpolls
have
been
breeding
in
the
autumn
?

ON
tlie
Continent
the
Twite
,
according
to
Dr.
Sliarpe
,
is
generally
distributed
throughout
Europe
,
west
of
Russia
,
and
south
of
the
Baltic
,
breeding
in
Scandinavia
.
Howard
Saunders
observes
that
it
"
is
found
in
summer
among
the
islands
and
along
the
coast
of
Norway
up
to
about
70°
N
.
lat.
,
but
in
Sweden
it
is
scarce
even
in
the
sub-alpine
districts
,
and
it
is
somewhat
doubtful
if
it
nests
in
Northern
Russia
.
On
migration
it
visits
Denmark
and
Northern
Germany
—
sometimes
passing
in
large
numbers
over
Heligoland
—
Holland
,
Belgium
,
and
France
;
but
it
seldom
goes
far
south
,
and
its
occurrences
in
Spain
,
Ital}^
,
and
Southern
Russia
,
are
few
and
far
between
.
"
In
England
during
the
breeding-season
the
Twite
occurs
locally
in
suitable
localities
from
the
midlands
northwards
;
in
Wales
,
according
to
J.
H.
Salter
,
it
is
almost
unknown
as
a
breeding
species
.
A
nest
was
taken
at
Westward
Ho
!
in
1904
,
and
a
supposed
nest
of
this
species
in
Surrey
in
1S94
;
in
Scotland
and
Ireland
it
is
pretty
generally
distributed
,
being
especially
abundant
in
the
west
of
Scotland
,
the
Hebrides
,
Orkneys
,
and
Shetlands
.
The
adult
male
in
breeding
plumage
has
the
feathers
of
the
crown
,
nape
,
and
back
ruddy
olive-brown
,
with
blackish
centres
and
paler
edges
;
the
rump
rose-↵red
;
wings
dark
brown
;
the
median
and
greater
coverts
with
paler
edges
,
whitish
towards
the
tips
;
the
quills
with
pale
edges
;
the
inner
primaries
margined
,
and
the
secondaries
tipped
with
white
;
tail-feathers
blackish-brown
,
the
three
outer
pairs
with
whitish
edges
.
A
superciliary
streak
,
the
lores
,
ear-coverts
,
and
cheeks
rufous-brown
,
the
ear-coverts
with
dusky
streaks
;
under
parts
mostly
pale
tawny-↵brown
,
clearest
on
the
throat
;
centre
of
breast
and
abdomen
sordid
white
,
as
are
the
under
tail-coverts
;
sides
of
breast
and
flanks
streaked
with
blackish
;
beak
pale
ochre-yellow
;
feet
dark
brown
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
has
no
rose-red
on
the
rump
;
and
in
width
of
crown
and
beak
differs
as
does
the
Linnet
.
After
the
autumn
moult
this
species
shows
less
of
the
dark
centres
to
the
feathers
,
and
the
beak
becomes
paler
.
Young
birds
nearly
resemble
the
female
,
but
have
some-↵what
more
dusky
beaks
;
the
males
,
however
,
show
a
tinge
of
rose-reddish
on
the
rump
.
The
Twite
,
Mountaiu
Linnet
,
Hill
Lintie
,
or
"
ueb
Liutie
,
"
as
it
is
variously
called
,
is
a
frequenter
iu
summer
of
the
hilly
districts
and
moorlauds
of
the
northern
portious
of
Great
Britaiu
and
Ireland
;
but
,
as
winter
approaches
,
it
deserts
the
bleaker
regions
and
wanders
in
small
flocks
through
the
cultivated
lowlands
in
search
of
seeds
of
charlock
aud
other
weeds
,
upon
which
it
feeds
:
at
this
season
it
frequently
consorts
with
the
Linnet
.
Lord
Lilford
says
that
his
acquaintance
with
this
species
is
chiefly
confined
to
having
often
met
with
it
on
the
moors
of
Scotland
,
when
Grouse-shooting
iu
August
and
September
.
"
At
that
season
it
is
generally
to
be
met
with
in
small
family
parties
of
six
or
eight
,
flitting
about
grassy
spots
amongst
the
heather
,
and
feediug
on
various
small
seeds
.
It
may
be
distinguished
,
even
at
some
distance
,
from
the
Common
Linnet
on
the
wing
b}'
its
lighter
make
,
darker
colour
,
and
sharp
call-note
.
In
captivity
this
species
becomes
very
tame
,
but
has
not
much
to
recommend
it
,
as
the
song
,
though
sweet
,
is
short
,
broken
,
and
of
little
power
.
"
The
call-note
has
been
described
as
resembling
the
word
hvah
-it
of
which
the
name
Twite
is
a
fanciful
rendering
;
on
the
wing
it
twitters
,
somewhat
in
the
fashion
of
the
Linnet
;
the
song
,
though
inferior
,
is
not
much
unlike
that
of
the
same
bird
.
The
nest
of
the
Twite
is
usually
built
low
down
iu
heather
,
sometimes
even
on
the
ground
among
grass
,
or
on
a
rock}^
ledge
;
it
is
also
said
to
occur
in
bushes
,
and
occasionally
in
ivy
:
it
is
neatly
formed
of
rootlets
,
or
heather
inter-↵mingled
with
grass-bents
,
and
is
lined
with
wool
,
hair
and
feathers
,
or
thistle-↵down
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
usually
five
,
are
pale
greenish-blue
,
speckled
,
spotted
,
blotched
,
or
streaked
with
reddish-brown
;
they
are
indistinguish-↵able
from
those
of
the
Linnet
,
though
most
observers
seem
to
agree
in
saying
that
they
are
more
frequently
streaked
than
eggs
of
that
bird
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
if
a
number
of
eggs
of
the
Goldfinch
,
Lesser
Redpoll
,
Twite
,
and
Linnet
were
indiscriminately
mixed
,
no
living
Ornithologist
could
sort
them
again
with
any
degree
of
confidence
:
they
all
vary
in
size
,
depth
,
and
tint
of
colouring
and
markings
.
Although
I
am
satisfied
that
the
Twite
could
,
as
easily
as
other
Finches
,
cimiplete
its
nest
in
two
or
three
days
provided
it
was
ready
to
la}-
,
Saxby
has
recorded
an
instance
in
which
both
sexes
were
occupied
for
eight
days
in
completing
one
:
this
is
often
the
case
at
the
commencement
of
the
breeding
season
,
*
when
the
birds
are
in
no
special
hurry
,
just
as
with
Canaries
in
the
breeding-cage
,
but
there
is
no
such
trifling
with
the
second
structure
.
Although
a
late
breeder
,
not
commencing
uidification
before
the
middle
of
May
,
the
Twite
is
double-brooded
.
It
is
probable
,
as
in
the
case
of
allied
species
,
that
this
bird
feeds
partly
upon
small
caterpillars
,
as
well
as
the
leaves
and
unripe
seeds
of
weeds
.
In
con-↵finement
it
is
passionately
fond
of
soft
food
.
From
time
to
time
I
have
had
Twites
brought
to
me
by
bird-catchers
;
and
,
in
1889
,
I
purchased
two
males
and
turned
them
loose
iu
one
of
my
cool
aviaries
:
they
very
soon
became
fairly
tame
,
but
nothing
like
so
confiding
as
Redpolls
;
the}-
,
nevertheless
,
sang
from
the
first
.
Most
birds
are
selfish
,
but
very
few
are
so
persistently
greedy
,
and
spiteful
withal
,
as
Twites
:
I
had
some
Canaries
in
the
same
aviary
;
and
,
as
the}'
had
barely
completed
their
moult
,
a
saucer
of
egg-↵food
was
daily
placed
in
the
aviary
for
their
benefit
;
no
sooner
,
however
,
did
the
Twites
discover
that
egg
was
good
,
than
they
simply
took
possession
of
the
saucer
,
savagely
attacking
every
Canary
that
attempted
to
come
near
it
until
their
some-↵what
voracious
appetite
was
sated
.
In
the
spring
of
the
following
year
my
Twites
began
to
assume
the
rosy
colouring
on
the
lower
back
and
rump
,
but
before
they
had
fully
developed
it
,
they
caught
septic
enteritis
from
a
sick
Canary
,
and
,
early
in
June
,
both
of
them
died
.
I
never
cared
to
purchase
others
.

Mr.
G.
C.

gives
the
following
interesting
account
of
his
experiments
in
breeding
Twites
in
confinement
:
—
"
A
pair
of
Twites
fAca)ilhis
flavirostris
)
have
this
season
bred
and
reared
young
in
my
small
aviary
,
and
as
it
is
,
I
believe
,
a
rather
uncommon
occurrence
,
a
few
notes
may
be
acceptable
******
The
birds
are
a
very
interesting
pair
,
both
being
abnormally
coloured
—
the
cock
about
half
white
pied
,
and
the
hen
pure
white
(
the
latter
may
be
known
to
some
of
my
readers
,
as
it
has
been
exhibited
at
both
the
Palace
and
Aquarium
shows
)
.
They
are
kept
with
about
half
a
dozen
other
Finches
iu
an
aviary
quite
out
in
the
country
.
The
hen
commenced
to
build
on
May
14th
,
and
laid
her
first
egg
on
the
17th
,
laying
altogether
five
eggs
and
sitting
closely
after
the
third
was
laid
.
I
did
not
again
look
at
the
eggs
,
but
saw
the
old
birds
busy
feeding
on
the
2nd
of
June
and
following
days
.
I
looked
in
the
nest
on
the
8th
,
hoping
to
find
some
fine
young
birds
,
but
the
nest
contained
only
one
poor
starved
thing
which
died
on
the
following
day
:
the
weather
was
very
storni}'
at
the
time
they
were
hatched
and
I
think
this
was
the
cause
of
their
doing
so
badly
.
On
the
15th
I
noticed
that
the
hen
had
nearly
completed
another
nest
,
and
she
laid
on
the
i6th
and
three
following
days
:
having
a
Redpoll
nesting
at
the
same
time
,
I
gave
her
two
of
the
Twites
'
eggs
,
making
up
the
number
for
each
with
infertile
eggs
;
both
birds
hatched
on
the
same
day
;
the
two
in
the
Redpoll
's
nest
perished
at
once
,
though
she
is
a
good
feeder
,
and
has
reared
two
broods
of
her
own
this
season
;
the
Twite
successfully
reared
hers
,
and
they
left
the
nest
un
July
iQtIi
,
and
arc
now
very
fine
birds
,
but
quite
normally
coloured
;
this
I
expected
,
as
I
have
reared
a
large
number
during
the
past
few
years
from
both
white
,
pied
,
and
cinnamon
Lesser
Redpolls
,
and
have
inbred
them
,
but
have
never
liad
one
vary
in
the
least
from
the
normal
colour
.
*
Young
Twites
are
not
nearly
so
precocious
as
Redpolls
;
the}'
were
a
long
time
before
thej'
attempted
to
peck
for
themselves
,
and
even
now
(
August
)
clamour
to
the
old
ones
for
food
,
whereas
I
have
seen
j-oung
Redpolls
a
week
after
leaving
the
nest
shell
hard
Canary-seed
.
My
birds
have
no
soft
food
given
them
,
but
as
much
of
the
flowering
top
of
the
dwarf-grass
,
dandelion
,
and
hard-head
tops
,
thistle
,
plantain
,
etc.
,
as
the}-
wish
,
and
as
many
aphides
off
rose
,
apple
,
or
plum-trees
as
I
can
at
the
time
obtain
;
infested
branches
being
put
in
the
aviary
for
the
birds
to
peck
them
off
.
The
latter
,
I
consider
,
are
very
essential
for
the
successful
rearing
of
Finches
in
confinement
,
especially
for
the
first
few
days
after
they
are
hatched
.

eastward
it

In

a
representative

replaces
it
,
in
which
the
general
plumage
is
more
ashy
,
and
the
breast
of
the
male
more
scarlet
in
colouring
.
Excepting
in
the
mountainous
parts
of
Scotland
,
where
it
appears
to
be
replaced
by
the
Twite
,
the
Linnet
is
pretty
generally
distributed
throughout
Great
Britain
;
it
has
,
however
,
been
rarely
seen
in
the
Shetland
Isles
.
The
male
Linnet
in
breeding
plumage
has
a
glossy
crimson
patch
from
the
base
of
the
upper
mandible
to
the
centre
of
the
crown
;
remainder
of

part
of

;

along

with

,
paler
at
the
base
of
the
lower
man-↵dible
;
feet
brown
;

.
In
captivity
all
crimson
disappears
from
the
plumage
,
and
both
beak
and
feet
become
paler
and
flesh-tinted
.
The
female
differs
in
the
absence
of
all
crimson
colouring
;
the
entire
upper
surface
browner
,
with
blackish
centres
to
the
feathers
,
the
much
more
prominent
streaking
of
the
under
surface
,
the
decidedly
broader
crown
and
base
of
beak
,
and
the
considerably
narrower
white
outer
margins
to
the
primaries
and
tail
feathers
.
It
also
differs
remarkably
in
the
form
of
the
wings
the
distinctions
being
precisely
what
one
notices
between
the
sexes
of
nianj?
bntterflies
.
The
different
form
of
the
wing
in
the
sexes
of
birds
appears
rarely
to
be
noted
,
the
mere
length
being
recorded
.
The
radins
and
nlua
in
the
male
are
longer
and
the
depression
in
front
of
their
junction
with
the
hiunerus
deeper
than
in
the
female
,
the
primary
coverts
are
less
exposed
in
the
male
,
whilst
the
second
,
third
,
and
fourth
longer
primaries
are
cmurgiuate
in
front
,
in
the
male
;
but
only
the
second
and
third
,
in
the
female
;
in
the
latter
sex
the
primaries
are
more
perfectly
graded
,
whereas
in
the
male
the
outer
edge
forms
a
slight
sinus
;
the
tail
differs
much
in
outline
,
as
will
be
at
once
seen
from
the
cut
.
Young
birds
are
very
like
the
female
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
feathers
of
the
crown
and
breast
have
greyish
borders
,
the
crimson
being
dull
and
presenting
a
mottled
appearance
;
this
(
in
fully
adult
males
)
gradually
changes
to
the
bright
colouring
at
the
approach
of
spring
.
*
This
species
,
which
is
variously
called
the
Grey
,
Brown
,
or
Red
Linnet
,
according
to
the
age
or
plumage
of
the
specimens
so
named
,
during
the
summer
months
haunts
commons
,
hedgerows
,
plantations
,
small
woods
,
orchards
,
and
shrub-↵beries
,
in
all
of
which
situations
I
have
very
often
found
its
nest
,
the
latter
being
most
frequently
constructed
in
a
furze-bush
or
hawthorn-hedge
,
though
I
have
taken
many
a
nest
from
hazel-branches
in
a
plantation
,
from
evergreen
and
other
shrubs
,
from
tangled
bramble
,
sometimes
almost
or
quite
on
the
ground
,
from
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
,
and
even
from
tufts
of
heather
.
In
size
,
strength
,
and
materials
the
nest
varies
considerabl}-
,
but
it
is
always
tolerably
compact
,
and
rarely
so
large
as
that
of
a
Greenfinch
:
among
those
which
I
took
under
the
impression
that
they
differed
,
I
selected
eight
for
my
collection
all
of
them
dissimilar
in
character
,
five
of
these
which
I
took
in
1883
I
thus
described
in
the
"
Zoologist
"
for
that
year
:
—
"
only
one
had
any
moss
in
its
con-↵struction
;
this
one
is
somewhat
slightly
built
for
the
species
,
but
the
walls
are
strengthened
with
coarse
straws
,
evidently
selected
from
a
dung-hill
.
The
second
,
excepting
that
it
is
not
so
deep
,
is
not
at
all
unlike
a
small
nest
of
the
Yellow
Bunting
.
Its
construction
is
,
however
,
decidedly
firmer
,
and
the
grasses
used
in
the
walls
are
similar
to
what
one
sees
in
the
nest
of
the
Greater
Whitethroat
.
The
third
nest
is
untidy
,
loosely
put
together
,
and
has
blackish
straggling
roots
projecting
from
the
sides
.
The
fourth
is
unusually
deep
,
and
is
formed
of
roots
,
fibre
and
wool
,
with
a
few
white
hairs
towards
the
interior
.
The
fifth
is
very
raereed
in
construction
,
formed
of
coarse
bleached
roots
,
lined
with
fine
fibre
and
wool
.
"
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
five
being
the
usual
clutch
;
they
are
either
pale
bluish-green
or
pale
huffish
;
those
of
young
birds
being
occasionally
unspotted
,
but
most
eggs
spotted
,
speckled
,
blotched
,
and
sometimes
(
though
rarely
)
streaked
with
reddish-
and
purplish-brown
;
the
markings
are
usually
most
numerous
at
the
larger
end
,
the
dark
spots
now
and
then
forming
a
subterminal
zone
.
The
flight
of
this
bird
is
swift
and
undulating
;
as
it
flies
it
usually
twitters
;
in
the
autumn
and
winter
when
Linnets
collect
into
flocks
,
often
of
considerable
size
,
and
pass
over
the
fields
in
search
of
food
,
this
twittering
is
especially
char-↵acteristic
.
The
bird-catchers
declare
that
the
birds
say
"
fe//
,
tell
,
telF
''
as
they
fly
,
and
at
a
distance
from
the
flock
j^ou
can
understand
what
is
meant
by
this
rendering
,
but
when
you
get
three
or
four
Linnets
under
a
sloping
roof
in
a
good
sized
aviary
,
and
listen
attentively
as
they
fly
together
from
end
to
end
,
you
find
that
what
they
really
say
is
—
"
turra
,
tit
,
turra
,
turra
,
tiirra!
''
The
ordinary
call
of
the
Linnet
is
a
rather
high
pitched
tivit
,
twit
;
the
sexual
call
is
tc-eivy
;
the
call
of
the
young
for
food
is
chkm
,
chhm
,
chiivi
;
the
song
,
to
my
mind
,
has
been
too
much
extolled
;
it
is
pretty
enough
,
but
there
is
too
much
chuckle
and
too
little
brilliance
in
it
;
the
notes
give
one
the
idea
of
whistling
througli
soap-suds
,
a
clear
note
escaping
at
the
end
of
the
phrase
through
bubble
and
sputter
—
"
c/ii'ck
,
chick
,
achock
;
chick
,
chicka-chick
;
chick
,
chick
,
achoo
''
;
moreover
,
half
a
dozen
Linnets
quarrelling
sound
nearly
as
well
as
one
Linnet
singing
.
For
clearness
and
vigour
not
a
note
in
the
song
of
Acanthis
ia)i)ial)i)i(t
will
compare
with
the
joyous
,
though
somewhat
monotonous
,
song
of
the
Chaffinch
:
of
course
I
am
aware
that
this
is
rank
heresy
;
but
heresy
is
often
truth
.
Howard
vSaunders
observes
that
"
it
is
the
capacity
for
learning
the
notes
of
other
birds
which
makes
the
Linnet
so
great
a
favourite
for
the
cage
"
:
perhaps
he
is
right
;
but
,
although
I
was
never
without
the
species
until
after
1900
,
since
I
first
began
to
keep
birds
,
often
having
as
many
as
six
or
eight
cock
Linnets
at
the
same
time
,
I
never
observed
any
capacit}'
for
niimicr}-
in
an}'
of
my
specimens
:
even
the
three
males
last
in
ni}'
possession
,
which
had
been
il_ving
together
in
the
same
aviary
for
six
or
seven
3-ears
,
sang
nothing
be3-ond
their
natural
wild
song
.
That
nestling
Linnets
will
learn
a
song
of
another
bird
if
kept
separate
from
examples
of
their
own
species
,
as
recorded
by
Sterland
(
Vide
Charles
Witchell
's
"
Evolution
of
Bird
Song
,
"
p.
170
)
*
is
nt)t
remarkable
;
but
it
does
not
account
for
the
caging
of
many
thousands
of
adult
Linnets
yearly
.
Linnets
are
known
to
be
largely
migratory
,
and
Seebohm
observes
:
—
"
Although
the
Linnet
is
a
resident
in
this
countrj-
it
is
probable
that
many
,
if
not
most
of
the
birds
of
the
year
join
the
flocks
of
this
species
that
pass
our
islands
every
autumn
,
and
migrate
further
south
with
them
.
"
The
food
of
the
Linuet
consists
principally
of
seeds
of
dock
,
plantain
,
dandelion
,
groundsel
,
thistle
,
etc.
,
and
it
is
fond
of
hemp
,
oats
,
and
turnip
seed
.
Probably
when
feeding
its
young
it
also
eats
aphides
and
small
caterpillars
.
In
confine-↵ment
German
rape
,
canary
,
and
oats
are
the
best
seeds
on
which
to
feed
it
.
Why
the
last-mentioned
very
wholesome
and
cheap
seed
is
so
seldom
used
by
aviculturists
I
can
not
understand
,
unless
they
imagine
that
the
smaller
hard-billed
birds
are
unable
to
crack
it
:
this
,
of
course
,
is
a
very
mistaken
notion
,
for
most
seed-eating
birds
,
including
Canaries
,
are
very
fond
of
oats
.
When
hand-reared
,
Linnets
become
extremely
tame
;
but
,
if
the}-
are
to
be
kept
so
,
they
must
be
caged
separately
;
for
association
in
an
aviary
with
other
birds
,
renders
them
as
wild
as
caught
specimens
in
a
few
days
;
a
fact
which
I
proved
first
in
1886
,
and
have
since
been
able
to
confirm
.
It
is
also
a
mistake
to
trust
the
rearing
of
caged
nestlings
to
the
parent
birds
;
I
tried
this
in
1887
,
hanging
up
the
cage
in
a
tree
near
the
nest
from
which
I
had
removed
the
young
.
The
uld
birds
are
willing
enough
to
feed
their
young
in
a
cage
,
but
the
strongest
nestlings
always
fight
their
way
to
the
front
,
so
that
the
weaker
birds
are
unable
to
get
sufficient
food
to
sustain
life
and
quickly
die
.
In
1888
I
successfully
reared
two
nests
of
Linnets
(
nine
birds
)
feeding
them
at
first
on
egg-food
;
and
,
as
they
grew
stronger
,
upon
scalded
German
rape
;
unfortunately
the
whole
of
them
died
after
their
moult
from
inflammation
of
the
bowels
.
Since
then
I

purchase
my
Linnets
from

The

it
has

.

Throughout
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
,
wherever
man
has
made
his
home
,
the
Sparrow
has
quickly
followed
liis
example
,
even
isolated
houses
usualh'
providing
a
pretext
for
the
presence
of
this
bird
,
sometimes
to
the
extent
of
scores
of
individuals
.

,
all
excepting

the

of
the
outer

,
but
the

primaries
with

at

sides
,
and
brownish
on
the
flanks
;
beak
leaden-black
;
feet
brown
;

.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
male
has
whitish-ash
fringes
to
the
feathers
of
the
head
and
throat
,
which
appear
to
be
very
delicate
in
texture
,
and
break
away
in
the
spring
;
*
the
under
parts
are
also
more
uniformly
ashy
,
the
upper
parts
duller
,
the
wing
band
yellowish
,
and
the
beak
becomes
j-ellowish
-
brown
.
The
female
is
duller
and
browner
than
the
male
;
the
broad
borders
to
the
feathers
of
the
mantle
and
back
being
tawny
rather
than
chestnut
;
the
superciliarj'
line
and
wing
bar
less
pure
and
conspicuous
;
the
under
parts
browner
,
with
no
black
on
throat
and
chest
.
Young
birds
chiefly
differ
from
the
female
in
their
paler
colouring
;
the
beak
is
dull
yellow
.
In
towns
the
House-Sparrow
is
a
useful
bird
,
inasmuch
as
it
feeds
largel}-
on
oats
and
other
grain
which
it
picks
from
horse-manure
,
and
which
otherwise
would
render
the
latter
less
suitable
for
garden
purposes
;
it
also
acts
as
a
scavenger
,
eating
scraps
of
all
kinds
which
have
been
thrown
into
the
gutters
,
and
which
if
not
removed
in
warm
weather
would
soon
become
offensive
.
In
very
dr}'
seasons
,
wlien
caterpillars
and
aphides
,
but
especially
the
latter
,
are
abundant
,
the
Sparrow
makes
itself
somewhat
useful
in
the
countr_v
,
although
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
drives
away
many
more
strictly
insectivorous
birds
who
could
do
the
same
work
far
more
efficiently
.
On
the
other
hand
both
to
the
gardener
and
farmer
the
Sparrow
is
a
positive
scourge
,
completely
ruining
beds
of
young
carnations
,
or
borders
of
crocuses
and
primroses
,
breaking
tender
shoots
in
its
ponderous
struggles
to
secure
insects
,
scattering
earth
right
and
left
over
freshly
gravelled
paths
in
its
search
for
newly
sown
flower-seeds
;
sampling
peas
,
fruit
,
and
grain
of
all
kinds
in
abundance
.
Moreover
,
even
the
insects
which
it
devours
when
feeding
its
young
,
onl}'
represent
a
portion
of
their
diet
;
whole
i^ows
of
young
beans
and
lettuce
are
devoured
and
partly
digested
by
the
parents
for
the
same
purpose
:
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
even
the
holding
capacity
of
the
ever
huugr}'
Sparrow
is
limited
,
and
that
it
feeds
its
young
from
the
crop
for
some
days
after
they
leave
the
nest
(
as
anyone
may
see
,
who
watches
the
birds
in
his
garden
,
or
in
the
thoroughfares
of
cities
and
villages
)
so
that
there
is
by
no
means
that
incessant
destruction
of
noxious
insects
during
the
rearing
of
a
Sparrow
's
progeu}'
,
which
renders
the
Titmice
such
enormous
benefactors
to
the
fruit-grower
.
*
The
3-oung
town-bred
Sparrow
,
instead
of
being
nourished
on
clean
partl}^
digested
grain
,
young
vegetables
,
and
insects
,
has
to
put
up
with
all
kinds
of
refuse
and
garbage
,
and
when
it
leaves
the
nest
and
is
almost
able
to
peck
for
itself
,
I
have
sometimes
been
amused
to
see
its
mother
satisfy
its
cry
for
food
by
scooping
up
a
beakful
of
mud
out
of
a
half-dried
puddle
and
emptying
it
into
its
gaping
mouth
:
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
sometimes
see
city-bred
birds
with
ruffled
plumage
and
dull
eyes
,
almost
too
ill
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
approaching
vehicles
.
The
nest
of
the
House-Sparrow
is
placed
in
any
suitable
hole
or
crevice
either
in
buildings
,
trees
,
or
banks
,
on
projecting
bricks
amongst
ivy
growing
over
walls
,
on
beams
in
barns
against
a
wall
or
upright
support
,
in
nests
of
House-↵and
Sand-Martins
;
but
in
nearly
all
such
situations
its
nest
is
not
characteristic
,
being
either
extremely
untidy
and
almost
shapeless
,
or
formed
like
that
of
most
Finches
in
cup-fashion
,
though
with
somewhat
less
regular
walls
The
more
typical
nest
is
built
in
the
branches
of
trees
,
hedges
,
and
(
according
to
Dixon
)
in
furze-bushes
;
it
is
a
very
bulk}'
bag- shaped
structure
,
the
entrance
being
either
close
to
,
or
at
the
top
,
so
that
the
light
falls
more
or
less
directl}'
into
the
cavit}'
:
this
form
of
nest
is
also
usually
built
on
beams
in
barns
,
and
I
once
found
a
simply
gigantic
specimen
in
a
large
pail
liaugiug
on
tlie
branch
uf
a
tree
,
the
depth
of
this
nest
was
at
least
i6
-inches
,
and
the
width
close
upon
a
foot
:
it
was
too
bulky
to
carry
away
and
was
hardly
suitable
for
a
collection
,
so
I
left
it
where
it
was
.
But
the
most
marvellous
Sparrow
's
nest
I
ever
saw
is
one
in
nu-↵collection
obtained
from
the
forking
branches
of
a
large
hawthorn
,
at
Kemsley
,
near
Sheppy
;
it
is
roughly
circular
,
saucer-shaped
,
and
altogether
has
more
the
character
of
a
Duck
's
than
a
Sparrow
's
nest
;
the
four
eggs
in
it
also
all
differ
,
the
darkest
egg
being
similar
in
character
to
the
most
richly
coloured
eggs
of
the
Tree-Sparrow
,
whilst
the
lightest
is
v.'hite
with
smoky-grey
spots
and
dots
crowded
chiefly
at
the
larger
end
,
so
that
it
has
quite
a
Slirike
-like
character
,
(
figs
.
142
and
143
are
from
this
nest
.
)
The
number
of
eggs
ranges
from
four
to
seven
,
but
rarely
exceeds
six
:
the
colouring
both
of
grouud
-tint
and
marking
varies
more
than
in
most
birds
,
and
as
I
have
selected
all
the
best-marked
modifications
for
illustration
on
our
plate
,
it
would
be
only
a
waste
of
space
to
describe
them
;
but
it
ma}-
perhaps
be
as
well
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
whitest
and
least
boldly
marked
varieties
are
found
in
places
to
which
light
has
had
little
access
.
In
1877
I
had
clear
proof
of
the
unthinking
obstinacy
of
the
Sparrow
,
a
pair
having
built
in
the
roller-box
of
a
sun-blind
during
dull
weather
,
the
pulling
down
of
the
blind
with
the
first
hot
day
destroyed
the
nest
;
no
sooner
,
however
,
was
the
blind
pulled
up
than
the
Sparrows
set
to
work
and
replaced
it
.
This
went
on
so
continually
and
repeatedly
that
I
wrote
to
the
late
Charles
Darwin
,
asking
him
whether
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
publish
the
fact
,
as
evidence
of
the
feeble
reasoning
powers
of
this
species
:
his
repl}'-
dated
May
9th
,
1877
,
I
still
have
,
with
other
letters
from
him
.
—
"
My
dear
Sir
,
I
have
been
always
inclined
to
think
that
Sparrows
were
acute
and
crafty
birds
,
but
j-ou
certainly
show
that
they
are
fools
,
and
if
they
go
on
behaving
in
so
idiotic
a
manner
,
you
will
do
quite
right
to
expose
their
conduct
in
some
public
journal
—
Yours
sincerely
,
Ch

Darwin
.
"
As
this
unreflecting
perseverance
under
difficulties
continued
altogether
for
nearly
a
mouth
,
I
sent
an
account
to
the
"
Zoologist
,
"
1877
,
pp
.
299-300
.
The
House-Sparrow
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
a
song
,
its
best
performance
being
little
more
than
a
chirrup
interspersed
with
sharp
chirps
,
but
often
early
in
the
morning
you
will
hear
several
apparently
engaged
in
conversation
c/iow
,
choiu
,
chivi
,
chivi
,
choiv
,
chivi
,
to
which
the
reply
is
whit
!
perhaps
followed
b}'
two
or
three
rapid
harsh
chirps
:
chivi
is
the
cry
of
the
3^oung
for
food
,
and
the
adult
bird
when
caught
in
a
trap
expresses
his
rage
by
indignant
chows
.
I
never
heard
the
Sparrow
utter
any
sound
like
tell
,
but
think
the
uote
-wliicli
the
late
Mr.
Witcliell
renders
tell
,
must
be
that
which
souuds
to
me
like
c/iov.1
.
This
species
is
of
no
interest
as
a
cage-bird
,
unless
hand-reared
:
a
caught
Sparrow
rarel}^
lives
long
,
is
always
wild
,
vicious
,
voracious
,
and
unmusical
;
if
haud
-reared
it
has
been
known
to
learn
and
sing
the
sougs
of
the
Goldfinch
,
Linnet
,
Canary
,
and
Skylark
.
A
friend
of
mine
had
one
which
imitated
the
Canary
's
song
perfectly
,
but
seemed
ashamed
of
its
performance
,
for
it
always
turned
its
face
to
the
wall
and
sang
quite
softly
;
it
also
never
sang
until
the
evening
when
the
Canaries
had
gone
to
sleep
.
For
feeding
caged
Sparrows
I
should
recommend
sunflower-seed
,
oats
,
Canar}'
,
and
German-rape
;
groundsel-
and
plantain-heads
;
with
a
few
insects
and
their
larvae
.
Albinism
seems
to
be
on
the
increase
in
this
species
,
and
more
particularly
in
Loudon
;
where
,
if
one
examines
each
flock
that
one
passes
in
a
half-hour
's
walk
through
the
streets
,
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
to
see
several
pied
varieties
:
there
are
always
two
or
three
among
those
which
collect
for
crumbs
in

of
the

throughout

from

,
in

slightly
beyond

"
The
distribution
of
this
species
in
Great
Britain
is
imperfectly
known
,
owing
to
its
general
resemblance
to
the
House-Sparrow
and
its
comparative
rarit}-
,
but
it
is
believed
to
be
most
abundant
in
the
eastern
and
midland
counties
of
England
,
and
the
eastern
counties
of
Scotland
:
in
Ireland
it
was
not
discovered
until
1852
,
but
is
steadil}'
extending
its
range
and
increasing
in
numbers
.
A
colony
is
said
to
have
existed
at
Belmullet
since
1902
;
another
was
discovered
near
Killala
iu
1907
;
a
pair
nested
in
Co
.
Derry
iu
1906
;
in
Donegal
four
nests
with
eggs
were
found
in
1907
,
and
a
single
bird
was
seen
in
Sligo
the
same
year
.
It
is
believed
that
in
the
autumn
the
numbers
of
our
resident
Tree-Sparrows
are
largely
added
to
,
by
flocks
of
immigrants
from
the
north
;
many
hundreds
arriving
on
our
east
coast
,
in
compau}'
with
Greenfinches
,
during
October
and
November
.
The
Tree-Sparrow
chiefly
differs
from
the
House-Sparrow
in
its
slightl}'
inferior
size
,
chestnut
crown
and
nape
,
a
white-bordered
triangular
black
patch
on
the
ear-↵coverts
,
a
second
white
bar
across
the
wing
;
and
in
the
fact
that
the
female
scarcely
differs
from
the
male
.
Young
birds
have
the
black
markings
replaced
by
brown
,
and
the
wing
bands
suffused
with
buff
.
During
the
sunnner
months
this
species
iu
our
islands
differs
somewhat
in
its
habits
from
those
on
the
Continent
,
seeming
to
avoid
towns
and
the
larger
villages
,
and
(
according
to
Seebohm
)
chiefly
haunting
"
the
fields
and
wilder
districts
away
from
houses
"
;
but
curiously
enough
the
whole
of
the
nests
which
I
have
taken
,
both
in
Kent
and
Norfolk
,
were
fouud
in
holes
in

On
the
Continent
,
however
,
"
(
says
Seebohm
)
"
the
bird
has
so
far
overcome
its
shj-ness
,
and
adapted
itself
to
circumstances
as
to
frequent
the
towns
,
and
is
quite
as
pert
and
impudent
as
its
congener
,
which
it
otherwise
resembles
in
its
habits
.
"
As
a
site
for
its
nest
the
Tree-Sparrow
seems
to
prefer
holes
in
pollard
willows
when
obtainable
,
and
,
more
often
than
not
,
the
selected
hole
is
at
the
top
of
the
stump
,
though
I
have
also
taken
it
out
of
a
hollow
and
decayed
lateral
branch
,
about
five
feet
from
the
ground
:
in
Norfolk
all
the
nests
I
found
were
in
willows
;
but
in
Kent
I
took
one
nest
from
a
hole
in
the
front
of
an
old
oak-↵tree
facing
the
road
,
whilst
Lord
Lilford
says
that
in
Northamptonshire
they
"
are
to
be
found
nesting
generall}'
in
small
colonies
of
three
or
four
pairs
iu
old
hollow
trees
,
especiallj^
(
in
our
neighbourhood
)
decayed
ash
,
willows
,
and
walnuts
.
"
Yarrell
speaks
of
the
species
as
building
"
in
the
thatch
of
a
barn
,
in
company
with
the
House-Sparrow
,
not
,
however
,
entering
the
thatch
from
the
inside
of
the
building
like
them
(
sic
)
,
but
by
holes
iu
the
outside
"
;
whilst
Howard
Saunders
mentions
its
building
"
beneath
the
tiles
of
roofs
,
as
well
as
under
the
coping
of
old
walls
and
in
sea-cliffs
"
;
I
have
taken
it
from
a
hole
iu
a
ruined
lime-kiln
;
and
,
in
the
"
Zoologist
"
for
1887
,
p.
265
,
I
recorded
the
fact
of
my
finding
a
nest
with
six
perfectly
typical
eggs
(
on
May
24
th
)
in
an
exposed
mole-burrow
in
a
brick-earth
cutting
at
Kemsley
,
near
Sheppy
.
Nidification
lasts
from
May
to
August
,
nests
being
most
abundant
in
the
latter
half
of
May
.
The
nest
is
usually
bag-shaped
,
consisting
of
a
mere
thick
lining
to
the
hole
in
which
it
is
situated
;
the
top
being
widely
open
,
so
that
the
light
generally
falls
directly
upon
the
eggs
;
the
materials
are
similar
to
those
used
by
the
Common
Sparrow
—
straw
,
hay
,
and
a
mass
of
poultry-feathers
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
;
they
are
rather
smaller
than
those
of
the
House-Sparrow
,
and
var3'
nearly
as
much
(
perhaps
quite
as
much
,
if
one
could
obtain
a
sufficient
series
to
decide
the
point
)
;
I
have
taken
them
greenish-white
,
with
scarcely
perceptible
grey
speckling
;
greenish-white
,
speckled
with
grey
,
spotted
with
two
shades
of
sepia
,
sometimes
with
the
heaviest
markings
iu
a
subterminal
zone
;
somewhat
greyer
,
mottled
and
streaked
with
grey
(
not
unlike
an
egg
of
the
Pied
Wagtail
)
;
greyish-white
,
thickly
mottled
and
blotched
with
grey
,
most
densely
at
the
larger
end
,
also
with
one
or
two
blackish
dots
(
not
unlike
a
Titlark
's
egg
)
;
dull
white
,
heavily
blotched
and
streaked
with
vandyke-brown
in
two
shades
,
and
with
small
grey
shell-spots
;
similar
,
but
so
densely
streaked
and
splashed
with
brown
as
almost
to
bide
the
ground-colour
;
lastly
rufous-brown
,
speckled
and
streaked
,
especially
at
the
larger
end
,
with
darker
brown
(
resembling
a
reddish
variety
of
the
Tree-Pipit
)
.
The
darker
and
more
ruddy
eggs
are
mo-t
characteristic
of
the
species
;
but
most
of
those
which
I
obtained
from
Kentish
nests
were
of
the
lighter
varieties
,
though
the
eggs
in
one
clutch
sometimes
exhibit
considerable
modification
in
this
respect
.
It
is
possible
that
the
colouring
of
the
eggs
may
have
a
local
significance
,
inasmuch
as
Lord
Lilford
's
experience
in
Northamptonshire
led
him
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ground-colour
,
as
a
rule
,
was
lighter
than
in
eggs
of
the
House-Sparrow
;
whilst
those
which
I
obtained
in
Norfolk
were
usually
remarkable
for
their
darker
ground-tint
,
although
exceptions
did
occur
.
It
seems
to
me
more
probable
that
light
in
some
way
affects
the
colouring
of
eggs
;
inasmuch
as
,
not
only
are
most
eggs
which
are
laid
in
the
dark
pure
white
,
but
all
those
which
I
have
found
in
heavily
shaded
positions
have
been
pale
and
little
marked
,
in
comparison
with
those
exposed
to
direct
daylight
;
the
lightest
eggs
of
the
Tree-Sparrow
which
I
obtained
in
Norfolk
were
those
taken
from
the
horizontal
branch
of
a
willow
,
where
the
light
only
entered
imperfectly
over
one
side
of
the
nest- cavity
;
those
in
the
top
of
the
stump
,
which
were
fully
exposed
to
the
sky
,
were
deepest
iu
cuUmriug
;
the
uest
contaiuiug
au
almost
white
egg
was
from
the
ruined
liuie-kilu
,
and
was
ahuost
as
much
in
the
dark
as
if
it
had
been
taken
from
a
Sand-Martin
's
burrow
.
Lord
Lilford
's
eggs
being
taken
from
holes
in
full-sized
trees
,
and
not
from
the
tops
of
pollards
,
were
probabl}'
but
little
exposed
to
light
.
The
Tree-Sparrow
is
a
more
active
sprightly
bird
than
its
commoner
relative
;
and
,
although
it
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
a
song
,
*
its
chirruping
is
somewhat
more
melodious
,
its
chirp
is
sharper
,
and
the
indignant
utterance
of
a
recently
captured
bird
is
shriller
.
Although
the
Tree-Sparrow
does
not
breed
so
continuously
as
the
House-↵Sparrow
,
which
in
mild
seasons
appears
to
rear
family
after
famih'
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
year
,
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
frequentl}'
produces
three
broods
in
a
season
.
When
feeding
its
young
it
eats
caterpillars
,
spiders
,
and
various
kinds
of
insects
,
as
well
as
leaves
and
unripe
seeds
of
weeds
;
but
at
other
times
it
appears
to
confine
its
attentions
principally
to
different
kinds
of
seeds
.
On
several
occasions
bird-catchers
have
offered
me
Tree-Sparrows
at
from
twopence
to
threepence
apiece
;
but
the
birds
looked
so
vindictive
and
chirped
so
savagely
that
,
considering
their
powerful
beaks
,
I
decided
not
to
risk
associating
them
with
the
other
members
of
my
feathered
family
.
Although
opinions
differ
greatly
respecting
the
character
of
this
species
,
I
am
satisfied
that
I
adopted
the
safest
course
.
Stevenson
(
Birds
of
Norfolk
,
Vol
.
I
,
p.
209
)
says
:
—
"
In
confinement
the
Tree-Sparrows
are
certainly
the
shyest
and
most
untameable
of
any
birds
I
have
ever
introduced
into
my
aviary
,
and
even
time
seems
to
work
but
little
change
in
their
wild
nature
,
as
on
the
approach
of
an}'
person
,
whether
a
stranger
or
not
,
they
dash
about
the
cage
iu
a
reckless
manner
,
and
when
exhausted
and
panting
with
fright
,
will
creep
into
any
corner
or
dark
spot
to
escape
notice
.
"
Lord
Lilford
observes
:
—
"
In
captivity
the
Tree-Sparrow
thrives
well
upon
canary-
and
millet-seed
,
and
becomes
very
tame
.
"
t
Swaysland
,
who
has
had
considerable
experience
in
keeping
many
of
our
British
Birds
,
remarks
:
—
"
When
caught
do
not
place
immediately
iu
an
aviar}-
,
as
they
would
then
invariably
sulk
and
behave
wildly
,
frightening
the
other
birds
,
but
rather
keep
in
a
small
cage
until
tame
.
"
Howard
Saunders
(
Manual
,
p.
174
)
says
:
—
"
In
captivity
this
species
has
bred
with
the
House- Sparrow
.
"
It
would
,
therefore
,
appear
that
,
if
properly
treated
,
this
species
does
become
stead}'
enough
to
breed
in
confinement
.
I
have
been
told
,
by
Aviculturists
who
have
kept
the
Tree-Sparrow
,
that
it
is
not
tyrannical
in
an
aviar}'
;
it
must
,
however
,
be
borne
in
mind
,
that
an
indi-↵vidual
does
not
necessaril_y
exhibit
the
characteristics
of
a
species
;
even
half
a
dozen
specimens
may
all
be
of
a
peaceful
disposition
(
as
was
the
case
with
my
Robins
,
which
never
fought
with
any
but
their
own
species
)
.
Ou
the
other
hand
one
vicious
Tree-Sparrow
,
associated
with
birds
weaker
than
itself
,
might
do
much
mischief
in
a
verj'
sliort
space
of
time
:
its
powerful
beak
would
enable
it
to
kill
or
maim
any
smaller
or
weaker
bird
without
the
least
trouble

Although
the
type
of
the
family
FringiUidcc
and
,
therefore
,
the
Finch
of
Finches
,
this
species
and
the
Brambling
differ
much
in
their
habits
from
the
other
British
species
of
typical
Finches
(
Fringi/Iincr
)
and
one
is
surprised
that
any
man
,
having
the
knowledge
of
living
birds
which
Seebohm
undoubtedly
had
,
should
have
been
content
to
place
forms
with
Tit-like
habits
(
Siskin
,
Goldfinch
,
Redpolls
)
in
the
same
genus
with
the
true
species
of
Fringill
—birds
which
have
the
habits
of
Buntings
.
If
distinctive
structural
characters
were
wholly
absent
,
one
could
understand
it
.
The
Chaﬃnch
is
distributed
as
a
breeding
species
throughout
Europe
almost
up
to
the
North
Cape
,
but
in
the
south
of
Europe
it
chieﬂy
haunts
the
mountains
during
the
breeding
season
,
wintering
in
the
plains
.
It
occurs
locally
in
Morocco
and
Algeria
,
and
winters
in
Egypt
.
In
Asia
it
is
said
to
breed
in
Palestine
,
Asia
Minor
,
and
Western
Persia
,
and
to
winter
in
Turkestan
.
In
Great
Britain
the
Chaﬃnch
is
generally
distributed
;
breeding
freely
in
all
wooded
or
cultivated
districts
,
aud
in
solitary
bushes
on
the
more
barren
portions
of
our
islands
.
The
fully
adult
male
Chaffinch
in
breeding
plumage
has
the
forehead
velvety
black
,
the
crown
and
nape
steel
blue
,
the
former
sometimes
tinged
with
green
,
the
latter
somewhat
ashy
;
tlie
mantle
bright
chestnut
;
lower
back
bluish
ash-grey
at
base
of
feathers
,
sap-green
at
tips
,
changing
to
bright
sap-green
on
the
rump
and
upper
tail-coverts
;
lesser
and
median
wing-coverts
white
;
greater
coverts
black
tipped
with
white
;
quills
smoky-brown
,
with
narrow
dull
yellow
edges
to
the
outer
webs
;
two
central
tail-feathers
smoky-brown
,
remaining
feathers
blue-black
;
the
two
outer
feathers
with
broad
wedge-shaped
white
patches
,
that
on
the
outer-↵most
one
occupying
fully
half
the
feather
;
sides
of
head
,
throat
,
breast
,
and
iVont
of
belly
vinous-chestnut
,
lower
belly
aud
flanks
somewhat
duller
and
greyer
;
under
tail-coverts
white
;
beak
leaden-blackish
,
paler
beneath
;
feet
dull
brown
;
iris
hazel
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
feathers
of
the
crown
have
brownish
edges
,
the
under
parts
are
slightly
paler
and
the
beak
is
flesh-brown
,
with
dark
tip
.
The
female
has
the
crown
and
back
buffish-brown
,
aud
the
under
parts
buffish-grey
;
it
also
appears
to
be
slightly
smaller
than
the
male
.
The
young
in
first
plumage
are
similar
to
the
female
,
but
rather
paler
:
in
the
first
year
the}'
do
not
attain
their
full
beauty
,
the
crown
being
brownish
with
two
dusky
longitudinal
stripes
;
indeed
the
full
sheeny
lustre
is
not
acquired
until
about
the
third
year
;
the
median
wing-coverts
also
are
more
exposed
in
old
birds
,
making
the
white
belt
across
the
wing
broader
.
*
Pied
examples
of
the
Chaffinch
are
not
ver}'
rare
,
and
the
white
in
the
plumage
certainly
increases
with
age
.
I
caught
one
in
my
garden
many
years
ago
,
aud
exhibited
it
for
two
years
running
at
the
Crystal
Palace
Bird
Show
.
A
second
bird
presented
to
me
about
1904
,
developed
a
white
spot
on
the
nape
which
increased
in
size
with
each
successive
moult
.
Like
the
British
Buntings
,
the
Chaffinch
both
runs
aud
hops
;
on
the
ground
it
almost
invariably
either
runs
or
walks
;
also
during
the
summer
months
it
is
almost
exclusively
insectivorous
;
like
the
Buntings
again
,
it
accustoms
its
young
to
taking
food
from
its
beak
at
a
much
earlier
age
than
do
the
other
typical
Finches
:
its
position
,
therefore
,
should
certainly
be
at
the
end
of
the
Subfamily
of
which
it
is
the
type
,
and
immediatel}'
before
the
Einbcrizina
.
It
has
even
been
asserted
that
the
Chaffinch
pairs
on
the
wing
,
but
this
fable
is
based
upon
its
violent
and
impetuous
courtship
,
in
which
respect
it
corresponds
with
the
members
of
the
New
World
genus
Sycalis
,
both
sexes
sometimes
falling
to
the
earth
strug-↵gling
desperately
.
No
sooner
,
however
,
is
the
heu
Chaffinch
once
snbdued
than
she
is
treated
with
gentleness
and
affection
;
pairing
frequently
takes
place
on
the
earth
,
but
sometimes
on
a
branch
.
In
the
autumn
there
is
a
considerable
immigration
of
Chaffinches
,
chiefly
on
the
eastern
and
south-eastern
coasts
of
England
,
and
it
would
seem
that
there
is
a
return
migration
earl}'
in
the
year
,
as
this
species
passes
over
Heligoland
both
in
September
and
March
.
Early
in
February
the
Chaffinch
begins
to
practise
his
song
;
at
first
this
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
full
powerful
melody
which
is
eventually
developed
;
but
merely
sounds
like
tsip
,
tsip
,
tsip
,
tioyi-nl
,
ioi)yi'rI
,
a
sort
of
liquid
bubbling
;
a
little
later
there
is
an
effort
to
get
in
the
terminal
notes
,
then
by
twos
and
threes
the
other
notes
come
out
weakly
;
until
,
by
March
,
the
full
song
is
remembered
and
rings
out
from
the
trees
and
hedgerows
;
when
perfect
it
is
a
full
rattling
scale
,
ending
variousl}-
in
different
individuals
,
although
the
same
bird
at
times
varies
his
terminal
phrase
:
sometimes
it
is
cliuclia
c/turr
,
sometimes
fiisi-iar
,
and
frequentl}'
ivhcatcar
;
the
bird-catchers
call
the
birds
which
use
the
first
phrase
"
c/iucktvados
,
'
"
and
those
that
use
the
two
last
"
kiss-me
dears
.
"
In
Kent
,
and
I
believe
in
some
other
counties
,
the
Chaffinch
is
said
to
sing
—
"
If
we
wait
another
month
,
we
shall
have
the
Wheatear
.
"
The
call-note
of
the
Chaffinch
is
,
I
believe
,
that
described
by
my
late
friend
Mr.
Charles
Witchell
as
"
a
loud
short
whistle
very
rapidly
slurred
upwards
in
the
interval
of
about
a
fifth
or
sixth
.
It
may
be
pronounced
hvi/
.
"
*
The
call
of
the
}'Oung
for
food
is
chizzif
,
cltizzit
,
cliizzit
;
Mr.
Witchell
(
who
,
however
,
renders
it
cliizzic/c
)
,
sa3'S
that
he
has
heard
the
old
birds
utter
the
same
note
.
The
war-cry
undoubtedly
is
a
shrill
cliick
,
chick
,
with
a
slight
metallic
n
sound
before
the
k
:
this
cry
has
been
variously
written
tzviiik
,
spiiik
,
pink
,
bink
,
and
fink
;
it
is
usually
uttered
twice
only
by
our
Chaffinch
,
but
the
Madeiran
Chaffinch
repeats
it
rapidly
four
times
;
so
that
it
almost
leads
up
to
his
rather
monotonous
and
poor
song
,
the
terminal
phrase
of
which
was
never
uttered
by
my
male
example
.
As
the
song
of
the
Chaffinch
is
itself
sung
in
rivalry
and
as
a
challenge
,
there
is
every
reason
for
believing
that
it
has
been
gradually
evolved
from
the
single
note
of
defiance
and
not
from
the
call-note
.
The
nest
of
this
species
varies
exceedingh-
;
not
,
as
has
been
stated
,
with
the
deliberate
design
of
the
bird
to
conceal
it
;
for
,
if
such
were
the
case
,
this
pretty'
little
structure
would
never
be
so
glaringl}'
conspicuous
as
it
sometimes
is
;
but
simply
from
the
fact
that
,
like
most
birds
,
the
Chaffinch
uses
those
materials
which
are
most
hand}^
provided
that
they
are
capable
of
being
woven
into
a
soft
warm
mass
.
The
nest
is
most
freqiieutl}'
placed
in
hawthorn
hedges
,
where
mimicry
of
its
environment
wonld
be
absolutely
useless
;
preference
is
given
to
hedges
enclosing
orchards
,
but
roadside
hedge-rows
are
often
utilized
,
as
also
those
along
the
margins
of
woods
;
the
forks
of
young
fruit-trees
and
the
boughs
of
old
apple-trees
are
sometimes
selected
as
nesting-sites
,
and
Seebohm
speaks
of
the
"
lichen-
and
moss-covered
branches
of
the
birch-
and
ash-trees
,
far
up
in
the
towering
branches
of
the
oak
,
the
alder
,
and
the
poplar
,
and
on
the
lowly
branches
of
the
holly
,
more
rarely
of
the
yew
,
and
freciuentl}-
in
the
gorse
shrubs
.
"
I
have
found
it
in
the
yew
,
but
never
in
gorse
.
The
nest
takes
from
five
da^-s
to
a
fortnight
to
construct
,
all
depending
upon
whether
the
bird
is
ready
to
la^'
.
In
form
it
is
a
small
neat
cup
,
slightl}'
con-↵tracted
at
the
top
,
and
tolerably
deep
;
but
curiously
enough
Seebohm
quotes
a
note
h\
a
Mr.
C.
Doncaster
on
a
very
aberrant
nest
seen
by
him
on
a
thorn
tree
by
the
river
Derweut
,
which
appears
to
have
been
like
that
made
by
an
English
Chaffinch
sent
to
New
Zealand
,
and
which
has
been
figured
b}'
Dixon
as
evidence
that
birds
do
not
inherit
the
design
upon
which
they
construct
their
nests
.
In
the
year
1896
I
again
turned
a
Canarj-
loose
in
an
aviary
,
and
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
prove
the
fallacy
of
Dixon
's
belief
,
by
building
a
cup-shaped
nest
in
a
bunch
of
fir-twigs
,
her
only
pattern
being
set
b}-
a
Canary
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
aviary
sitting
in
the
usual
square
box
.
The
materials
of
the
nest
,
as
already
stated
,
vary
a
good
deal
;
the
normal
t\pe
being
firmly
felted
together
and
formed
of
moss
,
a
few
lichens
and
spiders'
cocoons
,
and
lined
with
rootlets
and
hair
,
intermingled
,
or
covered
,
with
a
la3'er
of
thistle-↵down
;
but
one
of
my
nests
has
a
rather
rough
aspect
,
being
constructed
of
roots
and
fibre
,
mingled
with
fine
worsted
,
and
with
hardl}-
any
moss
or
lichen
in
the
outer
walls
,
but
with
the
usual
lining
;
others
have
feathers
mixed
with
the
usual
materials
in
the
lining
.
The
eggs
,
four
to
six
in
number
,
are
,
as
a
rule
,
either
greenish
,
or
rosy
flesh-coloured
,
the
markings
consisting
of
diffused
sienna
or
ruddy
brownish
patches
and
streaks
,
some
of
which
enclose
blots
,
commas
,
dots
,
streaks
,
or
hair-lines
of
blackish-brown
;
in
some
eggs
the
reddish
markings
are
chiefly
massed
over
the
larger
end
:
in
others
the
darker
markings
form
a
subterminal
zone
,
whilst
in
rare
instances
they
are
wholly
absent
,
the
eggs
being
bluish
,
slightly
clouded
with
I'eddish
:
the
rarest
t3'pe
,
of
which
I
have
only
taken
two
clutches
,
is
exactly
like
some
eggs
of
the
Bullfinch
,
clear
blue
,
with
grey
shell-spots
,
purplish
patches
,
and
almost
black
surface
spots
.
The
Chaffinch
certainl}-
frequently
rears
three
broods
in
a
year
;
nidification
lasting
from
April
sometimes
to
August
.
The
natural
food
of
the
Chaffinch
in
summer
,
as
already
stated
,
consists
largely
of
insects
,
their
larvae
,
spiders
,
and
the
soft
foliage
and
unripe
seeds
of
weeds
;
but
at
other
times
it
lives
chiefl}'
upou
various
kinds
of
seeds
of
weeds
,
and
of
grain
.
In
confinement
it
may
be
kept
for
3'ears
in
health
without
insect
food
,
but
nevertheless
a
few
caterpillars
,
mealworms
,
cockroaches
,
or
spiders
certaiul}^
are
good
for
it
.
I
think
it
was
about
the
year
1887
that
I
took
and
hand-reared
a
nest
of
four
young
Chaffinches
,
which
eventually
proved
to
be
two
pairs
:
the
nestlings
are
not
eas}^
to
feed
,
as
the}^
always
back
away
from
the
food
,
wagging
their
heads
violently
from
side
to
side
,
so
that
it
requires
patience
and
dexterity
to
pop
it
into
their
wide-gaping
mouths
.
My
two
male
birds
came
into
magnificent
colour
,
and
sang
extremely
well
,
probably
learning
their
song
from
a
ChafSnch
which
still
lived
in
one
of
my
aviaries
up
to
1897
,
though
it
must
now
be
quite
fifteen
years
of
age
.
This
old
fellow
was
a
fine
Essex
bird
when
I
bought
him
,
and
a
very
good
singer
;
and
,
although
he
had
been
unable
to
fly
for
two
or
three
years
,
and
his
white
eye-lashes
showed
his
advanced
age
,
he
still
sang
strongly
in
the
spring
:
but
his
chief
interest
to
me
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
once
took
a
Canary
to
wife
.
In
the
spring
of
1886
the
veteran
above-mentioned
was
flying
about
with
other
Finches
in
a
small
aviary
,
and
one
of
my
hen
Norwich
Canaries
took
a
violent
fancy
to
him
,
following
him
about
everywhere
:
at
first
he
did
not
seem
to
reciprocate
this
feeling
,
but
eventually
he
began
to
feed
her
from
the
crop
.
When
I
noticed
this
,
I
placed
the
two
apart
in
a
large
flight-cage
where
they
soon
paired
.
The
Canary
then
built
and
commenced
to
lay
,
but
I
only
found
the
shell
of
the
first
egg
(
which
was
so
exactly
marked
like
that
of
a
Chaffinch
that
it
would
have
deceived
anj^one
)
.
Although
I
found
the
Finch
feeding
his
wife
as
she
sat
in
her
nest
,
I
felt
certain
that
he
must
have
destroyed
her
first
egg
;
therefore
,
I
promptly
removed
him
to
another
cage
.
After
this
the
Canary/
laid
three
other
eggs
,
all
more
or
less
marked
like
the
first
,
and
sat
steadily
upon
them
for
three
weeks
;
when
,
knowing
that
there
was
no
chance
of
their
hatching
,
I
took
them
away
and
found
that
they
were
all
clear
.
*
The
idea
prevalent
in
the
minds
of
many
naturalists
,
that
the
Chaffinch
differs
from
other
Fringillida:
in
not
feeding
its
hen
and
young
from
the
crop
,
is
probably
based
upon
the
fact
that
it
begins
to
give
its
nestlings
solid
food
before
they
leave
the
nest
.
This
is
certainly
the
case
with
some
,
if
not
all
,
members
of
the
Sub-↵family
Emberizince
.

To
Great
Britain
the
Brambling
is
chiefly
a
winter
migrant
,
although
there
is
reason
for
believing
that
a
few
pairs
have
occasionally
remained
to
breed
with
us
.
Although
pretty
generalh'
distributed
throughout
our
islands
in
winter
,
it
appears
to
be
rather
more
numerous
in
Scotland
than
in
England
,
whilst
in
Cornwall
,
the
west
of
England
,
and
the
south
of
Ireland
,
it
is
rarer
than
else-↵where
;
and
in
very
severe
winters
it
is
more
abundant
,
but
particularly
near
beech-woods
.
The
adult
male
in
breeding
phnnage
has
the
upper
parts
blue-black
,
some
of
the
feathers
with
tawny
margins
,
the
middle
of
the
lower
back
and
rump
white
;
scapulars
and
lesser
wing-coverts
bright
tawny
;
median
coverts
white
;
greater
coverts
black
,
tipped
with
white
,
so
as
to
form
a
prominent
bar
;
quills
smoky
black
;
the
primaries
with
narrow
yellowish
white
margins
,
the
inner
ones
with
white
bases
;
secondaries
with
white
margins
towards
their
extremities
;
upper
tail-coverts
black
,
with
ashy
tips
;
tail
black
,
the
outer
feathers
with
a
little
white
at
the
base
of
the
inner
web
,
and
about
half
the
outer
web
broadly
white
;
sides
of
head
black
;
throat
and
breast
reddish-tawny
;
belly
white
,
the
flanks
spotted
with
black
,
and
the
thighs
black
behind
;
under
tail-coverts
white
,
tawny
on
the
vent
;
beak
blue-black
;
feet
reddish-brown
;
iris
hazel
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
feathers
of
the
head
and
back
have
broad
tawny
margins
,
as
also
have
the
tips
of
the
greater
wing-coverts
and
the
innermost
secondaries
;
the
quills
and
tail-feathers
have
fairly
broad
yellow
luargius
;
the
feathers
of
the
sides
of
the
ueck
have
ashy
edges
;
the
sides
and
flanks
are
washed
with
orange-tawny
,
the
black
spots
ou
the
flanks
are
less
prominent
,
and
the
beak
becomes
bright
ochre-↵yellow
,
with
brown
tip
.
The
female
somewhat
resembles
the
male
in
winter
plnmage
bnt
is
altogether
dnller
,
the
black
of
the
npper
parts
being
replaced
by
brown
,
and
the
bars
on
the
wings
are
mnch
less
prominent
.
The
yonng
at
first
are
very
like
the
female
,
bnt
the
males
qnickly
develop
their
characteristic
colonriug
.
The
breeding
plnmage
of
the
male
is
acquired
without
a
moult
,
and
it
is
said
that
the
change
is
effected
by
shedding
the
tips
of
the
feathers
.
Although
somewhat
less
active
than
the
Chafflnch
,
this
species
is
quite
as
quarrelsome
in
the
breeding
season
(
at
any
rate
in
confinement
)
;
in
winter
,
how-↵ever
,
the
flocks
which
travel
about
through
woods
and
over
fields
in
search
of
food
agree
perfectly
with
one
another
and
with
Chaffinches
.
Speaking
of
them
as
observed
near
Sheffield
,
Seebohm
observes
:
—
"
They
are
remarkable
noisy
birds
,
and
sit
upon
the
tree-tops
twittering
to
each
other
until
dusk
;
they
sometimes
fly
up
into
the
air
in
a
compact
mass
,
and
after
wheeling
round
several
times
again
alight
.
They
roost
in
the
yew
and
holly
trees
,
and
a
fair
proportion
of
them
seek
quarters
in
the
ivy
.
"
The
site
chosen
by
the
Brambliug
for
its
nest
is
usually
at
a
height
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
in
a
birch
or
fir-tree
,
at
the
junction
of
a
branch
with
the
trunk
;
the
nest
has
,
however
,
been
found
in
juniper
bushes
.

,
the
late
Mr.
E.
T.
Booth
says
:
—
"
In
the
summer
of
1866
,
while
fishing
on
the
river
Lyon
,
in
Perthshire
,
I
had
occasion
to
climb
a
beech-tree
to
release
the
line
which
had
become
entangled
in
the
branches
,
and
while
so
engaged
a
female
Brambling
was
disturbed
from
her
nest
,
containing
three
eggs
,
which
was
placed
close
to
the
stem
of
the
tree
.
As
I
was
anxious
to
procure
the
young
I
left
her
,
and
ou
visiting
the
spot
in
about
a
fortnight
the
nest
was
empty
,
and
,
judging
by
its
appearance
,
I
should
be
of
opinion
that
the
young
birds
had
been
dragged
out
by
a
cat
.
This
is
the
only
instance
I
have
ever
known
of
the
Brambling
attempting
to
rear
its
young
in
Great
Britain
.
"
In
the
"
Field
"
for
July
23rd
,
1864
,
p.
52
,
the
Rev
.
J.
C.
Atkinson
recorded
the
fact
of
a
nest
with
five
or
six
eggs
having
been
taken
at
Baldersby
Park
,
near
Thirsk
,
Yorks.
,
by
the
Hon
.
Guy
Dawnay
.
The
nest
is
larger
and
more
coarsely
made
than
that
of
the
Chaffinch
,
beiug
formed
of
white
and
buff
birch-bark
,
moss
,
lichens
,
and
spiders
'
web
,
and
lined
with
fine
grass
and
feathers
.
The
eggs
,
five
to
seven
,
usually
six
,
in
number
,
are
frequently
indistinguishable
from
those
of
the
Chaffinch
;
but
usually
they
are
decidedly
greener
,
with
smaller
and
less
defined
markings
;
a
hen
Brambling
formerly
in
my
possession
,
which
must
have
been
taken
as
a
cage-bird
to
South
America
and
liberated
there
(
I
picked
her
out
of
a
batch
of
newly
imported
Brazilian
Birds
)
occasionally
used
to
drop
an
tgg
from
the
branch
on
which
she
roosted
;
these
eggs
were
greenish-blue
,
like
those
of
a
Hedge-Accentor
,
but
with
four
or
five
deep
browu
spots
on
sienna-reddish
smears
towards
the
larger
end
;
of
course
they
were
always
broken
when
I
found
them
.
Like
the
Chaffinch
,
this
species
feeds
largely
on
insects
in
the
summer
time
,
and
on
various
kinds
of
seed
in
the
winter
,
it
is
especially
fond
of
beech-mast
,
Init
also
eats
the
seeds
of
many
noxious
weeds
,
and
fruit
.
On
the
ground
it
both
runs
and
hops
,
but
chiefly
the
former
.
The
call-note
is
usually
described
as
a
harsh
chirp
,
probably
referring
to
the
grating
zs/nvtro
which
it
utters
(
in
common
with
the
Greenfinch
,
the
Baya
and
Manyar
Weavers
,
and
many
other
birds
)
;
if
so
I
have
no
hesitation
in
asserting
positively
that
this
is
its
note
of
defiance
,
inasmuch
as
it
not
only
utters
it
after
its
song
,
but
when
disputing
with
another
bird
.
I
suspect
the
true
call-note
to
be
a
sharp
iv/t//
.
The
alarm-note
according
to
Seebohm
is
a
hurried
zw
,
ziv
,
but
I
have
not
heard
this
note
from
any
of
the
birds
which
I
have
kept
.
The
song
,
which
I
have
frequently
heard
sung
by
two
of
my
male
Bramblings
,
is
very
like
that
of
the
Chaffinch
without
the
terminal
notes
;
as
,
however
,
it
is
generally
followed
,
almost
immediately
,
by
the
harsh
cry
of
defiance
,
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
this
might
represent
the
ivhcat-car
or
iissi-car
of
that
species
.
The
scale
of
the
Brambling
is
rather
shorter
than
in
the
song
of
the
Chaffinch
,
and
delivered
with
less
vehemence
;
but
in
this
respect
individuals
maj-
differ
.
A
pair
of
Bramblings
formed
part
of
the
little
collection
with
which
I
com-↵menced
my
studies
in
aviculture
:
I
kept
them
with
a
pair
of
Goldfinches
,
a
Hedge-↵Accentor
,
and
one
or
two
other
birds
,
in
a
large
home-made
flight
cage
.
These
were
the
worst-tempered
Bramblings
I
ever
had
,
they
disputed
incessantly
,
and
at
first
gave
the
hen
Goldfinch
a
wretched
time
of
it
,
viciously
pecking
her
whenever
she
went
down
to
feed
near
them
;
but
one
day
the
cock
Brambling
made
a
mis-↵take
and
pecked
the
male
Goldfinch
,
which
simplj-
sprang
at
him
,
grasped
his
body
with
its
claws
,
and
tore
a
bunch
of
feathers
from
his
breast
.
After
this
both
Goldfinches
were
let
alone
,
but
the
male
and
female
Bramblings
fought
incessantly
,
the
hen
eventually
pecking
out
one
of
her
husband
's
eyes
,
soon
after
which
he
died
:
curiously
enough
she
only
survived
him
a
few
da^-s
.
In
1886
I
purchased
a
charming
male
bird
of
this
species
,
so
gentle
and
tame
that
its
plumage
was
always
in
perfect
condition
;
it
was
passionately
fond
of
bath-↵ing
,
and
sang
regularly
in
the
spring
:
unfortunately
I
kept
this
example
in
a
cage
,
and
,
at
its
third
moult
,
all
its
quills
grew
out
like
fans
,
giving
the
bird
a
most
wild
and
uncanny
aspect
;
indeed
it
was
such
an
object
that
I
gave
it
away
to
some
poor
child
who
took
a
fancy
to
it
.
About
1889
I
again
purchased
a
Brambling
from
a
bird-catcher
,
and
turucd
it
iuto
a
good-sized
aviary
with
other
British
species
:
it
soon
became
fairly
tame
,
sang
well
each
spring
,
and
rarely
made
itself
objectionable
to
its
associates
;
it
lived
principally
upon
seed
,
but
ate
a
certain
amount
of
soft
food
and
any
chance
insects
which
were
thrown
to
it
.
The
plumage
of
this
bird
was
so
perfect
that
a
friend
who
greatl}'
desired
to
have
it
for
show-
purposes
persuaded
me
to
let
him
purchase
it
.
Bramblings
have
not
only
bred
in
confinement
,
but
have
been
successfully
crossed
with
Chaffinches
.
The
Natural
History
Museum
at
Florence
contains
several
hybrids
between
the
Brambling
and
Chaffinch
.
These
specimens
show
ample
evidence
of
their
origin
,
and
were
netted
in
a
wild
state
by
the
Italian
bird-catchers
.

IN
spite
of
tlic
fact
that
the
Black- headed
Buutiug
has
hardly
auy
claim
to
be
called
a
British
bird
,
it
is
necessary
to
give
an
account
and
illustration
of
it
,
in
order
that
the
confusion
existing
in
the
minds
of
many
,
respecting
this
species
and
the
Reed
Bunting
,
may
be
abolished
.
Dr.
Sharpe
summarizes
the
distribution
of
this
bird
as
follows
:
—
"
Southern
Europe
from
Asia
Minor
and
Greece
,
westwards
to
Southern
German}^
and
Southern
France
,
eastwards
to
North-western
and
Central
ludia
.
"
Howard
Saunders
says
:
—
"
In
Greece
,
Turkey
,
the
Danubian
Provinces
,
Southern
Russia
,
Asia
Minor
,
Pales-↵tine
,
and
Northern
Persia
,
it
is
common
from
the
end
of
April
to
autumn
,
after
which
it
leaves
for
its
winter
quarters
in
North-western
and
Central
India
.
"
Gatke
,
speaking
of
it
in
Heligoland
observes
:
—
"
I
obtained
the
first
example
of
this
large
and
handsome
Bunting
on
the
4th
of
June
,
1845
^
i*^

''^^i

male
in

,
singularly
,
the
normal
black
markings
of
the
head
not
only
extend
downwards
along
the
sides
of
the
neck
,
but
the
fore-neck
also
has
a
long
black
longitudinal
patch
.
Since
that
time
the
species
has
occurred
here
about
fifteen
times
,
and
has
been
killed
in
most
of
these
cases
.
"
When
Seebohm
published
his
History
of
British
Birds
,
Vol
.
II
,
in
1884
,
only
one
example
of
this
.species
had
been
obtained
,
it
was
shot
by
Mr.
Robert
Brazener
,
on
Brighton
racecourse
,
on
the
3rd
November
,
1868
.
In
1888
,
Howard
Saunders
was
able
to
add
two
occurrences
of
the
Black-headed
Bunting
(
Manual
British
Birds
,
p.
197
)
one
recorded
by
the
Rev
.
J.
R.
Ashworth
(
in
the
"
Zoologist
"
for
1886
,
p.
73
)
as
having
been
shot
in
Nottinghamshire
;
and
the
other
as
having
been
captured
about
November
5th
,
1886
,
near
Dunfermline
,
and
exhibited
at
the
Crystal
Palace
Show
,
February
12th
to
17th
,
1887
,
where
it
was
recognized
by
the
late
Rev
.
H.
A.
Macpherson
.
It
was
then
purchased
by
Mr.
J.
C.
Steele
,
of
Beckenham
,
who
exhibited
it
at
the
Palace
every
5-ear
up
to
1891
,
taking
a
first
prize
up
to
1890
.
In
1891
it
was
recognized
and
labelled
as
"
Black-headed
Bunting
"
by
the
late
Mr.
Jenner
Weir
at
the
West
Kent
Ornithological
Show
;
but
,
knowing
that
the
carelessness
of
some
popular
writers
had
prejudiced
the
public
mind
b}-
confounding
this
species
with
the
Reed- Bunting
,
Mr.
Steele
probabl}^
wished
to
avoid
discussion
,
and
,
therefore
,
again
entered
it
for
the
Palace
Show
of
that
year
(
Februar}'
14th
to
19th
)
as
"
Bunting-Cock
.
"
The
bird
was
then
growing
old
,
and
was
in
poor
plumage
;
therefore
the
judge
passed
it
over
:
soon
afterwards
it
died
,
was
stufted
,
and
is
still
in
Mr.
Steele
's
possession
.
*
I
understand
,
from
a
letter
received
Feb.
6th
,
from
Mr.
W.
C.
J.
Ruskin
Butterfield
,
of
St.
Leonards
,
that
,
among
some
birds
in
the
possession
of
Mr.
Daniel
Francis
,
he
recently
recognized
an
example
of
this
species
.
It
was
caught
in
an
exhausted
condition
by
one
of
the
Coastguards
men
at
Bexhill-on-sea
,
on
Nov.
3rd
,
1894
.
Mr.
Butterfield
also
calls
mj-
attention
to
the
occurrence
of
the
large
race
of
the
Bullfinch
in
Yorkshire
in
1894
;
but
,
as
I
do
uot
consider
■major
can
ever
with
certainty
be
distinguished
from
large
examples
of
our
familiar
Bullfinch
,
I
did
not
think
the
fact
worthy
of
special
notice
.
It
is
quite
possible
that
these
so-called
"
Russian
Bullfinches
"
may
have
been
the
produce
of
typical
English
ones
,
just
as
my
frequently
so-called
"
Russian
Goldfinches
"
undoubtedly
were
born
of
Kentish
parents
.
A
male
Black-headed
Bunting
was
shot
at
Little
Common
,
Sussex
,
in
April
1905
,
and
it
is
recorded
as
occurring
on
Fair
Isle
,
in
September
,
1907
.
The
adult
male
in
the
breeding
season
has
the
crown
,
lores
,
sides
of
face
and
ear-coverts
black
;
the
back
and
rump
cinnamon-brown
;
wings
and
tail
brown
,
the
former
with
whity-brown
margins
to
the
coverts
,
and
broad
pale
borders
to
the
innermost
secondaries
;
the
outer
pair
of
tail-feathers
with
a
narrow
white
edge
to
the
inner
web
;
a
collar
at
sides
of
neck
and
entire
under
surface
bright
golden
yellow
;
beak
greyish-leaden
;
feet
pale
brown
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
is
altogether
duller
—
above
sandy-brown
,
with
darker
streaks
;
the
rump
slightly
yellower
,
the
wing-coverts
and
quills
margined
with
buflish-white
;
under
surface
sordid
white
,
more
sandy
on
the
breast
and
flanks
which
are
also
narrowly
streaked
with
brown
,
belly
and
under
tail
-coverts
washed
with
yellow
.
The
young
nearly
resemble
the
female
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
male
has
dull
greyish-brown
margins
to
the
feathers
,
and
the
rump
somewhat
tinged
with
yellow
,
so
that
it
then
more
nearly
resembles
the
female
.
Seebohm
thus
speaks
of
the
Black-headed
Bunting
:
—
"
In
Greece
and
Asia
Minor
,
it
does
not
arrive
until
the
end
of
April
,
amongst
the
last
half-dozen
summer
migrants
.
As
soon
as
it
comes
nest-building
commences
;
and
during
the
last
half
of
May
its
eggs
are
so
abundant
in
the
olive
and
vine
region
of
the
Parnassus
,
that
when
I
was
there
I
had
not
time
to
blow
more
than
half
of
the
clutches
which
I
found
or
saw
.
One
reason
may
perhaps
have
been
that
the
nest
of
this
bird
was
the
easiest
of
all
nests
to
find
.
The
males
were
so
extremely
handsome
and
so
very
conspicuous
that
whilst
it
may
perhaps
be
scarcely
correct
to
say
that
no
other
species
of
bird
was
so
common
,
certainly
no
other
appeared
to
be
so
.
"
Further
on
,
he
says
:
—
"
the
plain
joins
a
steep
rocky
slope
,
where
the
olives
are
smaller
and
more
scattered
,
and
where
clematis
and
white
and
pink
roses
half
conceal
the
stony
ground
,
and
dwarf
oleanders
,
pomegranates
,
figs
,
almonds
,
and
other
shrubs
compose
a
half-wild
landscape
,
the
only
sign
of
cultivation
being
a
vine-terrace
here
and
there
.
This
seems
to
be
the
paradise
of
the
Black-headed
Bunting
;
and
it
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
to
see
three
or
four
males
perched
conspicuou.sly
on
the
top
of
as
many
isolated
trees
,
singing
in
rivalry
.
When
disturbed
it
seldom
flies
far
,
but
drops
down
from
its
perch
,
and
after
a
short
flight
,
low
and
undulating
,
rises
up
again
to
the
nearest
tree-top
,
on
which
it
is
so
anxious
to
perch
that
its
legs
may
be
seen
extended
for
the
purpose
long
before
the
desired
haven
is
reached
.
"
The
nest
is
usually
placed
amongst
creepers
,
such
as
brambles
or
clematis
;
but
often
in
rose-bushes
;
sometimes
in
rows
of
peas
or
beans
,
and
occasionally
on
the
ground
.
It
is
large
and
loosely
constructed
of
the
seed-bearing
heads
of
small
flowering
plants
;
and
is
lined
with
dry
grass
,
bents
,
rootlets
,
and
hair
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
usually
four
;
they
are
pale
greenish-blue
,
with
brown
surface
spots
and
grey
shell
spots
;
usually
they
are
most
densely
massed
at
the
larger
end
,
btit
sometimes
they
are
scattered
over
the
entire
surface
;
they
also
vary
in
size
,
though
as
a
rule
both
large
and
small
spots
occur
on
the
same
egg
.
Jerdon
says
of
this
Bunting
(
Birds
of
India
,
Vol
.
II
,
p.
378
)
:
—
"
It
makes
its
appearance
in
the
Deccan
usually
about
the
end
of
November
:
is
found
in
immense
flocks
,
and
is
very
destructive
to
the
crops
of
jowaree
,
and
other
grains
.
It
leaves
early
in
March
,
and
certainly
does
not
breed
in
any
part
of
India
.
"
Tristram
states
that
it
breeds
in
Corfu
,
frequenting
brushwood
on
the
hill
sides
,
and
has
an
agreeable
song
.
"
According
to
Seebohm
this
song
ctmsists
of
only
"
two
or
three
slight
variations
of
nut
a
very
loud
nor
yet
\-ery
melodious
note
,
rapidly
repeated
,
with
a
slight
pause
in
the
middle
.
The
ordinary
call-note
is
a
loud
clitt
,
chit
,
and
the
call-note
of
one
sex
to
the
other
a
more
plaintive
and
longer
con-↵tinued
tsee-a
.
''
Howard
Saunders
says
:
—
"
The
call-note
of
the
male
is
a
vibrating
monotonous
chiriririy
As
a
captive
,
little
pleasure
can
be
derived
from
keeping
the
Black-headed
Bunting
in
a
cage
;
doubtless
its
feeding
is
simple
enough
,
millet
and
canary
forming
its
staple
diet
,
varied
in
the
summer
by
a
few
mealworms
or
cockroaches
;
when
wild
it
is
said
to
eat
grasshoppers
;
it
also
eats
a
little
fruit
.
A
caged
example
is
chiefly
interesting
for
the
show-bench
;
consequently
the
unfortunate
specimen
captured
in
Fifeshire
seems
to
have
had
a
busy
life
at
the
hands
of
his
owners
.
In
an
aviar}-
this
species
would
doubtless
l)e
more
interesting
,
but
it
would
want
watching
at
first
,
unless
associated
with
birds
as
powerful
as
itself
;
for
some
of
the
buntings
are

IT
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
improve
upon
Seebohm
's
account
of
the
distribution
of
this
species
:
—
"
Beyond
the
British
Islands
its
range
extends
throughout
Central
and
Southern
Europe
.
It
is
only
found
in
the
extreme
south
of
Norwa}'
and
Sweden
;
and
east
of
the
Baltic
its
northern
limit
appears
to
be
Riea
.
It
it
doubtful
if
it
has
ever
occurred
as
far
north
as
Moscow
or
the
Ural
Mountains
;
but
it
is
very
locally
distributed
in
Southern
Russia
,
where
it
is
a
partial
migrant
.
It
is
a
resident
in
the
Caucasus
and
Western
Turkestan
,
and
there
is
an
example
in
the
museum
at
Omsk
,
said
to
have
been
obtained
in
the
neighbourhood
.
It
is
a
resident
in
the
Canaries
and
North-western
Africa
;
but
in
Egypt
and
Arabia
Petrsea
it
is
only
found
during
winter
,
whence
it
probably
migrates
to
Central
Europe
to
breed
.
It
is
a
resident
in
Palestine
,
Asia
Minor
,
and
North
Persia
,
as
far
south
as
Shiraz

In
Great
Britain
the
Corn-Bunting
is
very
local
in
its
distribution
,
being
most
abundant
in
well-cultivated
grain-producing
districts
.
In
the
south
of
England
it
perhaps
deserves
its
name
of
"
Common
Bunting
,
"
though
it
is
by
no
means
so
abundant
as
the
Yellow
Hammer
,
but
northward
it
is
rarer
and
far
more
local
;
in
Scotland
it
occurs
most
generally
on
the
western
lowlands
during
the
summer
,
but
becomes
much
commoner
in
the
Eastern
districts
during
the
winter
;
westwards
its
range
extends
to
St.
Kilda
,
and
northwards
to
the
Outer
Hebrides
.
In
Ireland
it
is
local
,
but
common
in
suitable
districts
.
In
October
flocks
of
Corn-Buntings
migrate
to
our
.shores
,
considerably
adding
to
the
numbers
of
our
home-bred
birds
.
The
adult
male
Corn- Bunting
has
the
feathers
of
the
upper
surface
pale
brown
,
with
blackish
central
streaks
,
the
wing-coverts
and
innermost
secondaries
dark

The
female
is
slightly
smaller
than
the
male
,
and
grej-er
in
colouring
.
The
young
are
more
richly
coloured
,
the
wing-coverts
and
secondaries
more
prominently
bordered
with
fulvous
,
the
spotting
blacker
and
the
under
parts
tinged
with
buff
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
adult
birds
are
generally
more
rufescent
than
in
summer
.
Owing
to
its
sombre
colouring
and
its
habit
of
roosting
on
the
ground
,
this
species
has
sometimes
been
mistaken
for
a
Lark
,
and
in
autumn
and
winter
it
is
frequently
netted
in
company
with
Skylarks
:
possibly
for
this
reason
it
often
receives
the
name
of
Bunting-Lark
.
The
Corn-Bunting
chiefly
haunts
open
and
cultivated
districts
,
more
especially
where
cereals
are
freely
grown
.
It
is
not
a
nervous
bird
,
and
I
have
frequeutl}'
stood
within
a
few
yards
criticizing
its
ungainlj'
figure
and
miserable
apolog}^
for
a
song
as
it
sat
perched
upon
a
scraggy
bush
,
stump
,
or
fence
,
apparently
quite
satisfied
with
its
performance
:
the
latter
has
been
variously
described
;
but
,
to
those
not
acquainted
with
the
songs
of
some
of
the
Marsh
Troupials
of
the
New
World
,
or
the
Abyssinian
and
Rufous-necked
Weavers
(
which
have
the
same
character
,
though
more
prolonged
and
varied
)
the
most
accurate
idea
of
the
discord
is
conveyed
,
by
saying
that
it
resembles
the
sound
made
by
crushing
broken
glass
in
a
mortar
.
Seebohm
describes
the
song
as
'' kis
,
tcis
,
/ccs
,
tis-is-is-s-s-r-r-rc,'"
Howard
Saunders
as
''■tk-tic-tccsc,''
Lord
Lilford
as
"
tedious
and
rasping
notes
.
"
Seebohm
observes
that
"
the
ordinary
call-note
of
this
bird
is
very
loud
,
and
resembles
the
word
tzit
;
the
note
between
the
sexes
is
a
long
drawn-out
kaak
,
and
frequently
the
two
notes
are
heard
together
kaak^
Tlie
Corn-Bunting
,
in
spite
of
its
clums}^
aspect
,
is
very
strung
on
tlie
wing
,
and
may
be
recognized
from
the
fact
that
its
legs
hang
down
as
it
pursues
its
undulating
flight
;
it
also
frequently
sings
as
it
goes
.
It
is
very
fond
of
dusting
itself
in
the
road
after
the
manner
of
a
Sparrow
or
Skylark
.
The
nest
is
either
placed
in
a
depression
in
the
ground
,
in
a
tuft
of
grass
,
ragged-robin
,
or
other
low-growing
herbage
;
in
brambles
,
or
freshly-sprouting
hawthorn
on
ground
recently
cleared
;
also
in
fields
of
growing
corn
,
peas
,
or
clover
:
it
is
large
,
deep
,
cup-shaped
,
and
roughly
constructed
of
mingled
coarse
and
fine
grass
,
occasionally
(
though
rarel}-
)
watli
a
fragment
or
two
of
moss
,
and
sometimes
a
few
roots
;
the
bulk
of
the
nest
really
oonsisting
of
a
thick
inner
lining
of
fine
grass
and
black
horsehair
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
five
being
usual
;
the}-
frequently
resemble
abnormally
large
eggs
of
the
Yellow
Bunting
;
as
a
rule
they
are
pale
pinky-lilac
,
but
sometimes
creamy- white
;
the
markings
are
blackish-purple
or
deep
pitchy-brown
,
with
greyish-lavender
shell-↵markings
;
they
vary
considerably
in
character
,
either
consisting
of
finely
and
densel}-
scribbled
lines
,
of
boldly
scrawled
streaks
,
of
combined
streaks
and
blots
,
of
broad
irregular
smears
and
paler
blurred
spots
,
or
of
partly
couiluent
blots
,
sometimes
forming
a
zone
near
the
larger
extremit_y
of
the
egg
.
The
time
of
nidification
is
from
about
the
last
week
of
Ma}^
to
the
first
week
of
July
,
one
brood
only
being
reared
in
a
season
;
the
hen
is
a
close
sitter
,
and
rarely
leaves
her
nest
until
one
has
almost
put
foot
or
hand
upon
her
;
so
that
apart
from
the
size
of
the
eggs
,
there
is
seldom
any
difficulty
in
identifying
them
.
During
the
breeding-season
the
food
of
this
bird
consists
very
largely
of
insects
and
their
larvae
;
but
it
has
been
said
to
eat
both
peas
and
beans
,
and
it
is
certain
that
it
devours
cjuantities
of
unripe
corn
:
in
autumn
and
winter
the
Corn-Bunting
lives
almost
exclusively
upon
grain
and
various
kinds
of
seeds
,
in
search
of
which
it
frequents
rick-yards
,
stubble-fields
,
and
pastures
.
Although
this
species
is
tolerably
common
in
Kent
,
I
do
not
think
I
took
its
nest
more
than
half
a
dozen
times
during
the
seventeen
successive
years
in
which
I
was
an
enthusiastic
birds'-nester
;
but
as
I
had
a
strong
objection
to
trampling
down
crops
on
the
bare
chance
of
discovering
a
nest
,
it
is
probable
that
I
may
frequently
have
passed
within
a
few
yards
of
a
nest
of
the
Corn- Bunting
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
.
This
is
not
a
suitable
bird
for
the
Aviculturist
,
being
uupleasing
in
appearance
and
voice
,
as
well
as
voracious
;
it
is
,
therefore
,
rarely
caged
.
It
is
,
however
,
possible
that
we
underrate
the
vocal
powers
of
this
bird
,
for
in
the
"
Zoologist
"
for
1887
,
-
300
,
the
late
Rev
.
H.
A.
Macpherson
proves
that
it
has
some
capacity
for
mimicking
the
notes
of
other
species
;
he
says
:
—
"
When
birds'-uesting
on
the
Upper
Rhine
,
near
Mulheini
,
I
found
the
Corn-Bunting
abuudantl}-
established
on
the
lower
grounds
.
During
great
heat
the
males
sang
incessantly
(
their
mates
were
sitting
)
perching
indifferent!}-
on
the
ground
,
on
low
bushes
and
rails
,
on
the
tops
of
walnut
trees
,
and
on
tlie
telegraph
wires
.
Their
song
seemed
to
be
identical
with
the
dialect
of
those
I
had
met
with
at
home
,
with
a
single
exception
.
On
June
19th
,
a
Corn-Bunting
perching
on
a
telegraph
wire
poured
forth
a
liquid
and
sweet
song
,
embod3'ing
the
notes
of
the
Crested
Lark
,
which
latter
species
is
resident
,
though
scarce
,
in
that
district
.

the
Reed
Bunting

a
good
ear
,
and
can
be
trained
to
sing

,
but
I
never
suspected
the
Corn-Bunting
of
a
similar
capacit}'

THE
Yellow
Ammer
or
Hammer
,
as
this
bird
is
generally
called
(
^from
the
German
name
Goldammer
,
which
means
Golden
Bunting
)
*
is
generally
distributed
throughout
the
greater
part
of
Europe
,
breeding
in
Scandinavia
as
far
north
as
lat
.
70°
,
and
in
the
valley
of
the
Ob
,
in
Siberia
,
up
to
lat
64°
.
To
the
more
northern
portions
of
its
range
it
is
only
a
summer
visitor
,
and
it
only
visits
the
more
southern
portions
in
the
winter
,
but
in
the
temperate
regions
it
is
resident
;
in
winter
it
occurs
southwards
through
Turkey
into
N.W
.
Persia
and
Turkestan
.
Although
almost
unknown
in
S.W
.
Spain
,
it
is
said
to
be
resident
in
Teneriffe
.
Throughout
Great
Britain
tliis
species
is
abundant
and
generally
distributed
,
breeding
everywhere
excepting
,
perhaps
,
in
the
Shetlands
.
The
male
Yellow
Buntiug
in
breeding
plumage
appears
to
vary
consideiably
iu
beauty
of
plumage
,
the
birds
of
Mid- Kent
appearing
almost
like
a
distinct
species
from
those
of
North-west
Kent
,
owing
to
the
much
greater
development
of
yellow
on
the
head
.
The
crown
and
nape
bright
Canary-yellow
,
with
an
olive-↵brown
streak
across
the
forehead
and
bounding
the
sides
of
the
crown
;
*
or
lemon-↵yellow
much
more
streaked
with
olive-brown
;
remainder
of
upper
parts
chestnut
,
the
feathers
of
the
mantle
and
back
with
strongly
marked
black
longitudinal
streaks
;
wing-coverts
and
inner
secondaries
dark
smoky-brown
,
bordered
with
chestnut
;
remaining
secondaries
and
primaries
sooty-blackish
,
with
more
or
less
yellow
margins
to
the
outer
webs
and
slightly
ashy
tips
:
two
central
tail
feathers
dark
smoky-brown
,
with
pale
cinnamon-brownish
borders
;
remaining
feathers
sooty-↵blackish
,
\\-ith
very
narrow
yellowish
edging
to
the
outer
web
;
the
two
outer
feathers
with
large
snow-white
wedge-shaped
patches
on
the
inner
web
;
under
parts
lemon-yellow
,
an
olive-brown
streak
partly
bounding
the
ear-coverts
;
breast
and
flanks
slightly
washed
with
olive
and
streaked
with
olive-brown
;
beak
dark
horn-brown
on
the
culmen
,
becoming
more
leaden
at
the
sides
,
lower
mandible
much
paler
,
especially
along
the
edge
and
just
in
front
of
the
chin
;
feet
pale
flesh-brown
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
is
much
less
yellow
than
the
male
(
excepting
in
pairs
netted
in
West
Kent
which
,
even
in
breeding
plumage
,
differ
compara-↵tively
little
)
the
yellow
on
the
crown
represented
by
irregular
mottling
;
the
chestnut
of
the
upper
jarts
much
less
pronounced
,
excepting
on
the
rump
and
upper
tail-coverts
;
whilst
the
olive-brown
streaking
of
the
under
parts
is
more
defined
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
feathers
of
the
head
have
dark
tips
and
the
other
feathers
of
the
upper
parts
somewhat
ashy
margins
;
all
of
which
are
said
to
be
shed
in
the
spring
.
The
3'oung
nearly
resemble
females
in
winter
plumage
.
I
have
repeatedly
tried
to
get
hold
of
Yellow
Hammers
in
brilliant
plumage
;
but
,
living
on
the
borders
of
North-west
Kent
,
I
find
that
the
catchers
invariably
bring
me
dull-plumaged
birds
;
the
more
intelligent
of
them
have
assured
me
that
they
have
never
seen
a
brightly-coloured
male
Yellow
Hammer
in
the
neighbour-↵hood
,
which
exactly
agrees
with
my
own
experience
.
In
the
males
of
North
Kent
,
on
the
other
hand
,
all
the
males
are
especially
fine
in
colouring
,
the
dark
markings
on
their
heads
being
so
much
reduced
as
to
be
indiscernible
at
a
short
distance
.
The
Yellow
Hammer
is
abundant
in
all
open
country
,
but
more
especially
iu
the
better
cultivated
districts
where
one
sees
the
males
dotted
here
and
there
like
sentinels
on
the
topmost
sprays
of
the
hedges
,
or
sailing
with
rapid
undulating
flight
down
the
lanes
and
country
roads
;
in
wild
moorland
and
commons
this
bird
may
also
be
often
seen
,
though
at
times
wheu
it
sits
upon
a
flowering
furze-bush
it
is
overlooked
until
its
ringing
song
directs
one
's
attention
to
the
performer
.
The
song
of
the
Yellow
Bunting
is
not
especially
meritorious
,
though
bright
and
cheering
;
it
consists
of
a
rapid
descending
scale
made
up
of
a
repetition
ni
a
sharp
note
which
may
be
rendered
chip
or
cliink\
and
terminating
with
a
double
note
cluc
-chee
:
it
rather
suggests
the
shaking
up
of
shillings
between
the
hands
,
and
has
been
likened
to
the
words
"
Give
me
a
little
bit
of
bread
and
no
cheese
,
"
though
"
green
cheese
"
would
have
been
a
better
interpretation
:
occasionally
the
double
note
is
omitted
;
but
more
especially
when
the
bird
is
beginning
to
sing
in
the
early
spring
.
Being
a
late
breeder
this
species
continues
his
song
well
into
the
autumn
,
and
often
recommences
in
February
.
The
male
call-note
is
described
as
(Inch
,
cliicli
,
churr
.
The
nidification
of
this
bird
commences
about
the
middle
of
April
,
and
not
unfrequently
continues
up
to
the
end
of
August
:
I
have
myself
taken
a
nest
as
late
as
the
12th
August
with
three
fresh
eggs
(
Vide
"
Zoologist
"
for
December
,
1883
)
and
eggs
have
been
obtained
in
September
.
Tlie
nest
is
usually
placed
low
dowm
,
though
occasionally
at
a
distance
of
from
four
to
five
feet
above
the
ground
in
a
hedge
,
and
(
according
to
Howard
Saunders
)
exceptionally
at
a
height
of
seven
feet
.
I
have
often
found
it
in
low
bushes
,
but
only
once
in
furze
;
in
low
scrub
on
partially
cleared
waste
ground
;
in
holes
in
grassy
banks
by
the
road-side
;
or
under
a
low
dividing
hedge
between
fields
;
also
at
a
considerable
height
(
from
thirty
to
forty
feet
)
in
a
niche
in
the
side
of
a
gravel
or
chalk-pit
surrounded
by
tufts
of
plantain
and
grass
.
The
structure
is
a
loose
one
,
occasionally
so
much
so
that
,
when
taken
,
the
outer
walls
have
to
be
supported
to
prevent
their
falling
apart
;
these
consist
of
coarse
straws
,
dead
grasses
,
and
sometimes
a
few
twigs
interlaced
;
and
,
in
one
nest
which
I
took
from
a
hedge
,
there
was
an
edging
of
dead
chestnut
leaves
;
the
lining
consists
of
fine
withered
grass-bents
,
and
a
few
rootlets
and
horsehairs
.
The
eggs
of
the
Yellow
Hammer
are
extremely
variable
,
both
in
ground-tint
and
marking
,
although
most
of
them
exhibit
the
purplish-black
characters
which
have
earned
for
this
bird
the
title
of
"
Scribbling
Lark
.
"
In
tint
they
vary
from
greenish-white
,
through
greyish-lavender
,
to
pale
rosy-brownish
;
whilst
one
o^g^
,
taken
by
my
brother
Frank
,
in
Cornwall
,
was
bright
sieuua
-red
,
with
a
single
irregular
blackish
line
across
one
side
,
and
somewhat
resembles
a
rare
form
of
the
egg
of
the
Tree-Pipit
(
Plate
HI
,
fig
.
100
)
.
On
two
occasions
I
have
taken
the
greenish-white
egg
almost
or
entirely
without
markings
,
the
first
time
I
only
secured
the
first
egg
(
as
I
had
to
return
to
town
the
following
day
)
on
the
second
occasion
I
obtained
a
clutch
of
three
;
four
elliptical
eggs
in
one
clutch
were
dull
greenish-white
,
one
of
them
with
only
a
few
delicate
hair-lines
,
a
second
with
a
single
additional
rectangular
line
across
the
lower
third
enclosing
a
second
shorter
club-shaped
line
,
the
two
other
eggs
were
fairly
normal
in
marking
;
another
nest
of
four
is
slightly
tinted
with
lavender
,
the
markings
are
mostly
fine
,
and
look
like
tangled
silk
,
mixed
with
a
few
thicker
streaks
of
purplish-black
,
one
of
these
eggs
is
almost
a
perfect
sphere
;
other
greenish
eggs
have
extraordinary
markings
(
like
written
notes
in
music
,
oriental
letters
,
or
the
little
men
which
children
sometimes
draw
on
their
slates
)
intermixed
with
finer
scrawlings
and
patches
of
lavender
;
the
lavender
tinted
eggs
chiefly
differ
in
being
clouded
with
a
deeper
shade
of
the
same
colour
,
often
at
the
larger
end
;
one
egg
which
I
obtained
vaguely
resembles
that
of
a
Chaffinch
,
being
of
the
same
size
and
with
very
few
linear
markings
,
only
the
diffused
patches
are
greyish-lavender
,
instead
of
looking
like
blood-stains
.
The
number
of
eggs
in
a
clutch
varies
from
four
to
five
,
four
being
the
commoner
number
;
if
less
are
obtained
in
an
incubated
condition
,
either
the
first
nest
has
been
destroyed
before
the
completion
of
the
clutch
,
or
one
or
more
eggs
abstracted
or
broken
accidentally
.
During
incubation
the
hen
bird
sits
very
close
;
so
that
frequentl}'
you
may
almost
tread
upon
the
nest
in
stepping
through
tangled
brushwood
;
then
ffcyrclup
!
that
sound
of
hurried
flight
familiar
to
the
birds
'
-nester
,
makes
you
suddenly
look
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
startled
bird
rounding
a
bush
,
or
passing
over
a
hedge
;
and
in
a
minute
3'ou
are
crouching
down
and
turning
aside
the
foliage
to
look
at
its
treasures
:
often
when
searching
among
brambles
and
hawthorn
have
I
felt
my
hand
brushed
by
the
wing
of
this
bird
as
it
has
started
from
its
nest
.
I
am
satisfied
that
three
,
if
not
four
,
broods
are
reared
in
a
year
:
the
male
is
said
,
on
good
authority
,
to
assist
the
female
in
incubation
,
but
in
every
instance
in
which
I
have
flushed
the
bird
from
the
nest
,
it
has
invariably
been
the
hen
;
indeed
the
male
has
always
been
singing
somewhere
.close
by
.
It
is
well-known
that
the
hens
of
many
species
as
they
grow
old
assume
a
plumage
closely
resemb-↵ling
that
of
the
male
bird
;
therefore
,
unless
a
cock
of
this
species
has
actually
been
shot
,
or
at
least
been
heard
to
sing
,
upon
the
nest
,
and
its
sex
proved
,
I
think
the
statement
that
it
assists
the
hen
in
her
duties
,
should
be
received
with
a
certain
amount
of
hesitation
.
*
The
food
of
the
Yellow
Hammer
in
the
breeding-season
consists
largely
of
insects
and
their
larvae
;
also
,
like
all
the
Buntings
,
this
species
devours
insects
whenever
it
can
obtain
them
;
but
,
like
all
more
or
less
insectivorous
birds
,
it
is
still
fouder
of
spiders
,
and
this
fact
should
,
I
think
,
be
taken
into
account
when
summing
up
the
virtues
and
vices
of
birds
.
If
man
would
let
nature
alone
,
he
would
find
the
balance
perfect
,
but
he
interferes
everywhere
and
makes
a
mess
of
it
.
In
autumn
and
winter
the
Yellow
Bunting
feeds
largely
upon
grain
and
seeds
of
weeds
,
wandering
over
the
country
in
flocks
in
company
with
Chaffinches
,
Bramblings
,
etc
.
Although
a
beautiful
bird
,
the
wild
caught
Yellow
Hammer
never
commands
a
high
price
,
bird-catchers
generally
being
well
satisfied
to
receive
a
sliilling
for
a
pair
:
the
fact
that
the
bird
is
not
a
fine
singer
parti}'
accounts
for
this
,
but
the
wildness
of
newly
caught
specimens
is
another
serious
drawback
to
the
popularity
of
this
species
;
inasmuch
as
,
after
weeks
of
confinement
,
it
still
rattles
about
its
cage
whenever
it
is
approached
,
uttering
a
whining
sort
of
chirp
.
An
aviary
suits
it
far
better
.
In
October
,
1888
,
I
purchased
a
pair
from
a
bird-catcher
,
and
turned
them
into
a
large
covered
aviar}-
:
in
the
succeeding
spring
the}'
built
a
typical
nest
in
an
.irbor-vita
;
but
,
as
already
related
previously
,
a
hen
Hedge-Sparrow
took
possession
of
this
nest
as
soon
as
it
was
completed
,
and
subsequently
the
unhappy
Buntings
were
a
long
time
in
deciding
upon
a
new
building-site
;
towards
the
end
of
July
they
selected
a
very
damp
corner
on
the
ground
behind
a
marsh-flag
and
began
to
build
;
they
,
however
,
never
finished
this
nest
,
but
continued
to
carry
about
hay
and
straw
in
an
undecided
desultory
manner
until
November
,
when
they
finally
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
.
Early
in
1890
,
both
birds
died
:
possibly
they
did
not
receive
sufficient
insect-food
to
keep
them
in
good
health
.
Cases
have
been
recorded
in
which
this
species
has
been
discovered
sitting
upon
eggs
deposited
in
a
slight
depression
on
the
bare
ground
;
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
explanation
of
such
behaviour
is
—
that
its
nest
has
been
taken
.
I
once
removed
a
nest
with
three
eggs
from
a
hedge
,
and
passing
a
day
or
two
later
saw
the
bird
sitting
on
a
little
platform
of
ivy
twigs
upon
which
the
nest
had
been
partly
supported
;
as
I
approached
she
flew
away
,
disclosing
her
fourth
egg
.

THE
range
of
the
Cirl
Bunting
is
more
restricted
than
that
of
the
other
European
species
as
it
does
not
extend
into
the
northern
parts
of
the
Continent
.
In
Central
and
Southern
Europe
it
is
resident
,
but
in
Southern
Italy
,
Greece
,
and
Asia
Minor
,
it
seeks
the
mountains
for
breeding
purposes
.
In
Belgium
and
Holland
it
is
said
to
be
rare
.
It
has
been
found
breeding
in
Algeria
,
but
appears
to
be
chiefly
a
winter
visitor
to
North-west
Africa
.
Though
resident
in
Great
Britain
and
not
rave
,
the
Cirl
Bunting
is
decidedly
local
,
being
essentially
a
southern
species
.
Formerly
every
work
on
British
Birds
which
was
published
,
used
to
assert
that
this
bird
was
found
breeding
in
all
the
southern
counties
from
Cornwall
to
Sussex
,
being
apparently
absent
from
Kent
;
and
even
after
Mr.
Bidwell
had
reeogni/.ed
in
my
eollcctiou
a
cluteli
of
eggs
of
this
species
,
which
I
had
taken
at
Iwade
,
near
Sheppy
,
ou
Jnnc
5th
,
1877
,
as
being
nuqnestionably
those
of
R
.
cir/us
(
a
fact
which
,
I
believe
,
I
promptly
recorded
in
the
"
Zoologist
"
)
the
same
statement
was
repeated
,
until
the
appear-↵ance
of
Howard
Saunders
'
Manual
in
i<S8(S
.
It
has
,
however
,
been
found
breeding
as
far
northward
as
Yorkshire
,
but
it
is
of
accidental
occurrence
at
any
season
either
in
the
midlands
or
the
northern
counties
.
*
In
Scotland
it
has
occurred
as
a
chance
straggler
,
but
its
recorded
occurrence
in
Ireland
was
formerly
questioned
.
The
adult
male
Cirl
Bunting
has
the
crown
and
nape
olive-green
,
longitudinall}^
streaked
with
dull
black
;
the
rump
and
upper
tail-coverts
olivaceous
;
the
sides
of
the
head
blackish-olive
,
with
a
j-ellow
stripe
above
,
and
a
second
below
the
eye
,
from
the
base
of
the
beak
to
the
neck
;
the
chin
and
throat
to
the
sides
of
the
neck
dull
black
,
bounded
by
a
half
collar
of
lemon-yellow
;
across
the
chest
is
a
greyish-olive
belt
;
sides
and
flanks
chestnut
,
narrowly
streaked
with
black
;
remainder
of
under
parts
lemon-yellow
:
in
other
respects
this
species
nearl}'
resembles
the
Yellow
Bunting
,
the
back
,
wings
,
and
tail
being
verv
similar
;
the
beak
is
dark
horn-brown
above
,
but
paler
and
bluish
below
;
the
feet
yellowish-↵horn
;
the
iris
hazel
.
The
female
is
much
duller
,
and
chiefly
differs
from
that
sex
of
the
Yellow
Hammer
in
the
absence
of
yellow
on
the
crown
,
and
the
olivaceous
rump
;
the
yellow
of
the
under
parts
is
also
not
so
bright
,
and
the
streaking
is
better
defined
.
Young
birds
nearl}'
resemble
the
female
,
but
are
still
duller
.
The
male
,
after
the
autumn
moult
,
has
ashy
fringes
to
the
black
feathers
of
the
throat
,
which
,
however
,
disappear
in
the
spring
.
In
disposition
the
Cirl
Bunting
appears
to
nearh-
resemble
the
Yellow
Ham-↵mer
;
but
during
the
breeding
season
it
is
evidently
somewhat
more
skulking
,
for
although
I
have
frequently
heard
it
singing
in
the
hedges
and
in
rough
scrub
,
in
the
lanes
and
little
frequented
roads
of
Kent
,
I
have
very
rarel}-
seen
the
per-↵formers
:
even
in
an
aviary
I
found
it
at
all
seasons
ninch
more
shy
and
retiring
.
I
should
,
therefore
,
be
inclined
to
think
that
an
example
mentioned
by
Lord
Lilford
(
Birds
of
Northampton.shire
,
Vol
.
I
,
p.
176
)
must
have
escaped
from
confinement
,
after
some
years
of
captivity
in
an
aviary
.
He
sa^-s
:
—
"
as
I
was
watching
my
Emus
and
other
birds
in
the
courtyard
at
Lilford
,
a
fine
male
Cirl
Bunting
flew
down
from
a
high
elm
tree
,
settled
ou
the
ground
within
a
few
yards
of
where
I
stood
,
and
began
feeding
on
the
grain
which
had
been
scattered
for
the
Emus
,
and
at
which
several
Sparrows
and
Chaffinches
were
already
busy
.
I
had
this
bird
in
full
view
for
some
minutes
,
as
he
hopped
about
and
regaled
himself
,
till
he
was
attacked
by
a
Sparrow
,
and
flew
up
to
the
tree
from
whence
he
had
come
.
"
*
The
song
of
the
Cirl
Bunting
differs
from
that
of
the
Yellow
Hammer
chiefly
in
the
absence
of
the
terminal
double
note
;
it
has
,
therefore
,
been
compared
with
that
of
the
Lesser
Redpoll
and
Lesser
Whitethroat
.
The
call-note
of
the
young
and
adult
are
said
by
the
late
Mr.
Witchell
to
be
"
not
unlike
the
call-squeak
of
the
Tree
Pipit
"
;
according
to
Seebohm
the
adult
call-note
"
sounds
like
a
monotonous
and
plaintive
chea-c/icy
Subsequent
to
taking
niv
first
nest
of
the
Cirl
Bunting
in
1^77
,
I
frequenlh^
heard
and
occasionally
saw
the
cock-bird
in
the
same
neighbourhood
,
but
I
did
not
obtain
a
nest
again
till
1884
,
when
I
found
two
at
Tunstall
,
the
first
on
the
24th
and
the
second
on
the
30th
of
AIa\'
:
four
years
later
I
obtained
permission
to
nest
in
some
private
grounds
near
Frinstead
,
in
Kent
,
and
on
the
26th
May
I
took
m}-
fourth
and
last
nest
of
this
species
.
The
Cirl
Bunting
appears
to
be
double-brooded
,
the
first
nest
being
usually
built
some
time
in
Ma}-
,
and
the
second
in
July
.
The
sites
chosen
for
the
nest
are
ver}-
similar
to
those
selected
by
the
Yellow
Bunting
:
according
to
Howard
Saunders
who
found
it
not
uncommon
on
the
chalk-hills
of
Surrey
,
it
"
is
placed
in
a
bank
among
the
stems
of
a
hazel
or
other
bush
,
though
sometimes
in
furze
,
or
juniper
,
at
a
little
distance
from
the
ground
.
"
My
nests
were
all
found
within
a
foot
or
two
above
the
earth
,
the
first
in
a
stunted
furze-bush
tangled
with
a
blackberry
vine
,
two
others
in
low
juniper
scrub
overrun
with
bramble
,
and
the
fourth
in
a
young
hawthorn
bush
.
The
nest
is
tolerably
compact
internally
,
though
externally
somewhat
loosely
put
together
,
the
outer
wall
usually
consisting
of
coarse
dead
grass
,
bents
,
and
vegetable
fibre
;
the
lining
of
fine
fibre
and
black
horse-hair
;
occasionally
a
little
moss
is
said
to
be
used
in
the
lining
;
but
this
material
is
rarel}-
used
by
any
of
the
British
Buntings
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
five
(
my
nests
contained
respectively
foiir
,
four
,
three
,
and
two
eggs
)
and
are
often
somewhat
broader
than
those
of
the
Yellow
Hammer
,
they
are
white
,
generally
very
faintly
tinged
with
lilac
;
streaked
,
spotted
,
and
dotted
with
purplish-black
,
especially
towards
the
larger
end
;
with
small
,
and
frequently
indistinct
lilacine-greyish
shell-spots
.
The
markings
often
terminate
in
round
blots
;
and
,
occasionall}'
,
some
of
the
streaks
are
chocolate
.
Seebohm
describes
an
abnormal
nest
in
his
collection
as
"
somewhat
looselj'
put
together
,
and
made
externally
of
various
plant-stems
,
blades
of
grass
,
routs
,
aud
quantities
of
dead
leaves
.
It
is
lined
with
oue
or
two
scraps
of
moss
,
a
few
pieces
of
fiue
grass
,
and
a
great
quantity
of
short
hair
.
"
The
eggs
of
the
Cirl
Bunting
vary
much
less
than
those
of
the
Yellow
Bunting
;
but
Seebohm
states
that
some
of
them
liave
a
greenish-white
ground-↵tint
.
Lord
Lilford
says
:
—
"
The
few
nests
I
have
met
with
were
all
placed
on
steep
banks
by
the
side
of
a
road
or
footway
,
amongst
low
bushes
and
herbage
,
and
were
built
of
moss
and
grass-stalks
,
with
a
lining
of
cow
's
hair
.
"
Herr
Gatke
(
Birds
of
Heligoland
,
p.
371
)
,
states
that
he
has
only
twice
obtained
this
Bunting
on
the
island
;
he
gives
Zaiincviniur
as
the
German
trivial
name
of
the
species
;
but
Von
Homeyer
(
in
the
Gefiederte
Welt
,
1891
,
p.
444
)
applies
this
name
to
Einhoiza
cia
,
using
the
term
Zippa»n>icr
(
used
for
the
Meadow
Bunting
alone
by
Gatke
)
,
in
a
generic
sense
.
If
two
such
distinct
species
as
Embcriza
chins
and
E.
cia
are
each
called
"
The
Hedge
Bunting
"
b}'
well-known
writers
,
the
confusion
respecting
them
is
likely
to
be
as
fruitful
of
mischief
as
the
incorrect
application
of
the
trivial
name
of
Black-headed
Bunting
to
Einboiza
ichccnicluis
has
been
in
England
.
The
food
of
this
species
is
similar
to
that
of
its
congeners
;
consisting
largely
of
grasshoppers
,
beetles
,
moths
,
caterpillars
,
and
spiders
,
during
the
breeding-↵season
;
but
in
autumn
and
winter
,
of
various
seeds
and
grain
.
In
confinement
it
lives
well
on
the
usual
mixed
seeds
,
including
oats
,
with
the
addition
of
an
occasional
mealworm
,
cockroach
,
or
spider
.
Like
most
of
the
British
Buntings
,
the
Cirl
Bunting
(
if
kept
in
an
aviary
)
is
,
as
Lord
Lilford
observes
,
"
dull
,
silent
,
and
greed}-
.
"
Rarely
one
may
hear
it
sing
,
once
or
twice
perhaps
in
the
course
of
a
month
:
it
is
not
,
however
,
an
aggressive
bird
;
and
,
when
it
does
show
itself
,
makes
a
pretty
addition
to
a
collection
of
Finches
.
My
late
friend
,
Mr.
Phillip
Crowley
,
purchased
a
pair
at
the
Crystal
Palace
Show
some
years
ago
,
and
turned
them
out
into
his
mixed
garden
aviary
,
where
,
I
believe
,
they
lived
for
several
years
;
but
one
which
I
had
(
I
think
in
1893
or
1894
)
,
only
survived
for
about
a
twelvemonth
,
dying
suddenlj-
without
apparent
cause

Although
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
several
of
the
Ortolans
shot
,
captured
,
or
seen
in
Great
Britain
,
have
escaped
from
the
poulterer
's
shops
,
having
been
imported
from
the
Continent
to
supply
the
tables
of
the
wealthy
;
the
fact
that
it
is
a
common
species
at
no
greater
distance
than
the
north
of
France
,
renders
its
occasional
visits
to
our
coasts
extremely
probable
.
The
first
recorded
instance
of
its
occurrence
was
that
of
an
example
caught
in
Marylebone
Fields
,
and
figured
by
Brown
in
1776
,
since
which
time
a
good
many
specimens
have
been
either
obtained
or
seen
in
various
parts
of
England
;
many
others
in
Scotland
,
and
especially
from
Fair
Isle
,
where
a
number
arrived
in
May
1906
,
also
one
at
least
from
Ireland
.
The
adult
male
Ortolan
Bunting
has
the
head
,
nape
,
and
upper
breast
greenish-↵grey
;
eyelid
whitish
;
lores
,
a
moustachial
streak
,
the
chin
and
fore-throat
sulphur-↵yellow
;
back
,
wing-coverts
,
and
secondaries
pale
reddish-brown
,
with
blackish
central
streaks
to
the
feathers
;
lower
back
and
rump
with
barely
defined
streaks
;
the
remaining
feathers
of
the
wings
and
the
tail
brown
,
the
three
outer
tail
feathers
,
with
large
terminal
patches
of
white
on
the
inner
webs
;
lower
breast
,
belly
,
aud
under
tail-coverts
pale
browu
;
beak
vinous-brown
;
feet
reddish
clay-coloured
;
iris
dark
brown
.
The
female
is
altogether
duller
aud
browuer
than
the
male
,
the
head
greener
and
streaked
with
dark
brown
.
Young
birds
nearly
resemble
the
female
,
but
are
yellower
and
more
streaked
below
,
and
onl\'
have
white
patches
on
the
two
outer
pairs
of
tail-feathers
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
head
and
breast
of
this
species
are
somewhat
greener
,
and
the
beak
paler
,
more
flesh-coloured
.
According
to
Hamilton
,
the
Hindostani
name
for
this
bird
is
"
Jamjohara
.
"
Respecting
the
habits
of
this
bird
when
at
libert}*
,
Seebohm
remarks
:
—
"
I
found
the
Ortolan
Bunting
breeding
on
the
mountains
in
the
pine-regions
both
of
Greece
and
Asia
Minor
.
When
I
was
at
Valconswaard
,
we
constantly
heard
its
plaintive
monotonous
song
,
as
it
sat
perched
for
a
long
time
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
in
the
lanes
,
or
in
the
hedges
that
surround
the
fields
close
to
the
village
;
and
in
the
wilder
districts
of
Norway
,
when
driving
in
our
carioles
from
Lille-↵hammer
towards
the
Dovre
Fjeld
,
it
was
by
no
means
uncommon
in
the
trees
by
the
roadside
.
It
is
not
a
shy
bird
,
and
frequently
remains
for
a
very
long
time
on
the
same
twig
,
generally
near
the
top
of
the
tree
,
especially
in
the
evening
,
when
its
simple
song
harmonizes
with
the
melancholy
stillness
of
the
outskirts
of
the
country
village
.
"
The
nest
of
the
Ortolan
is
formed
in
the
latter
half
of
INIay
,
being
placed
in
a
slight
depression
"
on
the
ground
amongst
herbage
,
under
bushes
,
or
in
the
open
fields
.
It
is
formed
of
dry
grass
strengthened
with
roots
,
and
is
lined
with
rootlets
and
hair
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
and
vary
from
pale
lilac
to
rosy-salmon
,
boldly
blotched
,
spotted
,
aud
slightl}^
streaked
with
purplish-black
,
chiefly
towards
the
larger
extremity
,
where
the
markings
sometimes
form
au
imperfect
zone
;
the
shell-markings
are
violet-greyish
;
in
form
they
vary
much
in
the
same
manner
as
eggs
of
the
Yellow
Hammer
.
The
food
of
this
bird
does
not
materiall}-
differ
from
that
of
the
other
species
of
Emberiza
,
consisting
mainly
of
insects
in
spring
and
summer
,
and
of
seeds
and
grain
in
autumn
aud
winter
.
The
song
of
the
Ortolan
Bunting
consists
of
one
melauchol}-
whistled
note
repeated
five
times
,
the
fifth
repetition
being
prolonged
—
"
Hoo
,
hoo
,
hoo
,
hoo
,
/loooo
.
"
I
have
heard
it
dozens
of
times
,
and
am
absolutely
certain
that
this
is
a
fact
.
To
be
sure
of
a
song
,
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
note
of
the
exact
sounds
whilst
the
bird
is
uttering
them
;
if
you
wait
until
you
are
Ij'iug
in
bed
in
a
somnolent
condition
and
attempt
to
recall
a
song
,
you
ma}-
feel
quite
positive
that
you
have
hit
upon
the
very
notes
;
you
reach
over
to
your
pockets
and
abstract
pencil
aud
paper
to
jot
the
phrase
down
before
it
escapes
3'ou
:
later
on
,
30U
compare
3our
production
with
the
original
,
and
discover
that
you
are
wide
of
the
mark
:
there
is
absolutely
no
resemblance
between
the
dream
and
the
realit}-
.
About
1891
a
pair
of
Ortolan
Buntings
was
given
to
me
by
Mr.
P.J
.
Lowrey
;
and
,
judging
(
from
my
experience
of
Yellow
Hammers
and
Reed
Buntings
in
captivit}'
)
that
this
species
would
be
equall}'
inoffensive
,
I
turned
them
out
into
a
large
covered
aviary
with
English
Finches
,
and
many
small
Ploceine
Finches
.
At
first
the
Ortolans
were
quiet
enough
,
their
feathers
being
somewhat
abraded
(
owing
to
the
fact
that
they
had
been
kept
in
a
cage
in
some
small
bird-shop
)
:
no
sooner
however
,
had
these
birds
moulted
and
thus
recovered
their
full
power
of
flight
,
than
they
occupied
themselves
for
the
greater
part
of
each
day
in
chasing
the
unfortunate
Waxbills
and
lylannikius
all
over
the
aviar}'
.
Apparently
,
the
Ortolans
had
no
vicious
intentions
in
the
pursuit
of
their
weaker
associates
;
they
never
actually
pecked
them
,
when
thev
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
;
but
the}'
could
not
resist
the
pleasure
which
the
frantic
terror
of
the
little
Finches
evidently
gave
them
:
the}'
darted
up
and
down
the
aviary
almost
with
the
rapidity
of
a
Swallow
,
whilst
the
poor
little
hunted
birds
,
unable
to
escape
by
mere
speed
,
were
forced
to
fling
themselves
against
the
wirework
and
double
back
to
avoid
their
pursuers
.
Seeing
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
Ortolans
in
an
aviary
containing
Ornamental
Finches
,
I
now
captured
my
birds
and
placed
them
iu
another
aviary
with
Redwings
,
Greenfinches
,
Chaffinches
,
&
c.
,
here
they
suddenly
dropped
all
the
active
habits
which
had
previously
characterized
them
,
becoming
as
dull
and
listless
as
other
members
of
their
genus
:
their
health
,
nevertheless
,
was
always
perfect
,
and
their
plumage
tight
and
glossy
.
I
parted
with
this
pair
at
the
same
time
as
I
sold
my
Redwings
,
and
subsequently
they
were
made
use
of
for
show-↵purposes
.
In
the
late
autumn
of
1894
I
selected
a
male
Ortolan
from
a
consignment
of
Weavers
(
out
of
colour
)
which
had
just
been
received
from
Africa
:
it
had
been
imported
,
together
with
Abyssinian
and
Russ'
Weavers
,
and
with
these
I
kept
it
in
one
of
my
cool
aviaries
.
Like
its
predecessors
,
this
Ortolan
,
associated
as
it
was
with
naturally
quarrel-↵some
and
powerful
birds
,
was
singularly
quiet
and
retiring
in
its
demeanour
;
indeed
it
often
seemed
to
weary
of
the
constant
wranglings
and
strong
language
of
the
Weavers
,
and
perched
quite
low
down
,
or
even
on
the
earth
;
where
,
from
time
to
time
,
it
uttered
its
melancholy
little
monotonous
song
:
although
it
never
had
a
chance
of
securing
any
insect
food
,
all
of
which
was
greedily
devoured
as
soon
as
it
was
thrown
into
the
aviary
by
three
specimens
of
a
Cape
Weaver
SiVcrora
f
S.
capensis
?
)
it
appeared
to
find
all
that
it
needed
for
its
health
in
the
few
dried
ants'
cocoons
remaining
in
a
saucer
of
soft
food
,
which
had
already
been
picked
over
by
examples
of
Liolhrix
aud
Zosferops
:
it
also
ate
a
good
mauy
oats
,
in
addition
to
Canary
and
other
seeds
.
In
spite
of
their
usually
placid
l)ehaviour
,
this
aud
all
the
Buntings
are
very
pretty
additions
to
a
mixed
aviary
;
their
plumage
being
as
a
rule
quite
uninjured
aud
scrupulously
clean
.
Although
perhaps
not
.
so
passionately
fond
of
bathiug
as
some
of
the
more
typical
Finches
,
the}/
perform
their
ablutions
once
or
twice
each
day
in
a
methodical
aud
business-like
manner
,
which
is
probably
quite
as
effective
as
the
hurried
splashing
,
characteristic
of
a
Goldfinch
or
Canary
.

;
also

is
distributed
over
the
whole
of
Europe
from
the
North
Cape
to
the
Mediterranean
,
as
well
as
in
Western
Siberia
;
but
it
is
only
a
summer
visitor
to
the
more
northern
parts
of
its
range
,
and
chiefly
a
winter
visitor
to
the
extreme
south
;
at
this
season
it
is
also
met
with
in
Asia
Minor
and
North
x\frica
.
Races
of
this
species
occurring
in

south
of
Europe
,
iu
Siberia
,
Mongolia
,
uud
China
,
and
a

,
have

but
none

.
The
Reed-Bunting
is
resident
with
us
,
and
generally
distributed
throughout
our
islands
,
although
onh-
a
chance
visitor
to
the
Shetlands
.
In
the
autumn
there
is
an
extensive
immigration
from
the
Continent
,
which
reaches
our
eastern
coasts
and
the
coasts
of
Ireland
in
September
.
The
adult
male
has
the
head
,
including
the
chin
,
throat
,
and
centre
of
breast
jet
black
;
a
white
moustachial
streak
running
from
the
base
of
the
lower
mandible
to
join
a
white
collar
continuous
with
a
belt
which
bounds
the
black
of
throat
and
breast
;
feathers
of

,
wing-coverts
,
and
secondaries
black
,
bordered
broadly
with
bright
chestnut
;
lower
back
and
upper

partly
black-centered
;

After
the
autumn
moult
,
the
feathers
of
the
head
,
back
of
ueck
,
chin
,
throat
,
and
front
of
breast
,
have
tawny
or
brown
tips
,
and
the
feathers
of
the
lower
breast
and
belly
are
stained
at
the
tips
with
buff
.
In
the
female
the
feathers
of
the
head
are
dark
brown
with
reddish-brown
borders
;
the
lores
and
a
superciliar}^
stripe
bounding
the
ear-coverts
pale

otherwise
she
is
similar
to
the
male
,
though
slightly
smaller
.
The
young
bird
is
very
like
the
female
.
During
the
summer
the
Reed-Bunting
is
essentially
a
marsh-loving
bird
,
frequenting
all
moist
spots
in
the
neighbourhood
of
rivers

drains
,
or
streams
,
wherever
rushes
,
reeds
,
and
the
wiry
grasses
which
delight
in
damp
soil
abound
;
in
such
spots
its
nest
is
almost
sure
to
be
found
by
careful
searching
.
At
this
season
the
Black-bonnet
is
always
paired
,
but
as
autumn
approaches
it
wanders
over
the
country
in
small
flocks
,
often
associating
with
Corn
Buntings
,
Larks
,
Pipits
,
or
Wagtails
,
and
wandering
through
stubbles
and
rick-yards
in
search
of
scattered
grain
,
or
waste
corners
where
weeds
abound
,
the
ripened
seed
of
which
afford
them
food
.
But
the
summer
time
affords
the
most
satisfactory
opportunites
for
watching
the
habits
of
the
Reed-Bunting
,
and
Norfolk
is
one
of
the
best
counties
in
which
to
study
it
.
As
Stevenson
observes
:
—
"
the
broads
in
this
count}-
must
be
looked
upon
as
the
chief
home
of
this
species
,
where
they
(
sic
)
maj-
be
met
with
at
all
seasous
uttering
their
somewhat
harsh
aud
unvaried
notes
from
the
tops
of
the
bushes
,
or
whilst
clinging
to
the
reed
stems
;
aud
in
these
localities
the
nests
are
built
on
tlie
ground
,
frequently
at
the
foot
of
a
small
bush
,
placed
in
a
hollow
amongst
the
soft
moss
that
forms
the
foundation
.
"
It
was
around
these
broads
that
I
first
met
with
the
Reed-Bunting
in
any
numbers
;
I
had
seen
individual
examples
from
time
to
time
not
far
from
Canter-↵bur}'
,
but
I
never
obtained
the
nest
until
1885
,
when
I
first
met
with
it
on
Hickling
Marsh
on
the
13th
May
,
and
Mr.
Salter
sent
me
a
second
taken
at
Dounton
,
in
Salisbur_v
,
on
the
21st
May
.
Curiously
enough
,
although
I
had
never
come
across
it
during
many
vears
in
which
I
had
birds'-uested
in
Kent
,
the
mouth
after
I
had
secured
these
two
uests
,
my
friend
,
Mr.
William
Drake
,
forwarded
a
third
to
me
which
he
had
f )und
on
the
saltings
at
Kemsley
,
near
Sheppy
.
When
at
the
broads
,
in
June
,
1886
,
I
dropped
upon
a
nest
(
on
the
2nd
of
the
mouth
)
at
Mudfleet
,
contaiuing
five
entirely
unmarked
eggs
,
but
these
were
so
much
incubated
and
so
brittle
that
,
with
the
greatest
care
,
I
was
only
able
to
save
two
of
them
.
(
See
Jig
.
igS

J
All
my
nests
were
in
slight
depressions
in
mossy
ground
,
sodden
with
wet
and
not
always
safe
to
walk
upon
,
even
with
bare
feet
and
trousers
rolled
up
above
the
knees
;
indeed
I
and
my
companion
Mr.
O.
Jauseu
had
to
walk
very
circumspectly
,
part
of
the
marsh
here
and
there
being
detached
and
simply
floating
in
a
pool
of
deep
water
,
so
that
as
you
put
a
foot
down
it
would
dip
under
,
wetting
you
frequently
to
above
the
ankle
.
The
nests
are
not
con-↵spicuous
,
are
partly
overhung
by
wiry
grass-tussocks
or
sedge
,
and
might
easily
be
overlooked
,
excepting
for
the
presence
of
the
birds
which
causes
one
to
search
for
them
carefully
:
but
to
men
whose
eyes
have
been
trained
,
as
Entomologists
,
from
their
boyhood
,
aud
who
have
been
accustomed
to
recognize
and
pounce
upon
tin\'
ground
insects
,
a
bird
's
nest
is
a
very
large
and
conspicuous
object
,
however
cleverly
concealed
.
Tliis
is
a
very
strong
argument
against
the
theory
as
to
the
cause
of
mimicry
in
nature
;
for
it
seems
to
me
absurd
to
argue
that
insectivorous
birds
,
whose
eyesight
is
so
keen
aud
quick
that
they
can
follow
every
movement
of
the
tiniest
insect
on
the
wing
,
should
,
when
anxious
for
food
,
be
deceived
b}'
the
vague
resemblance
of
a
conspicuous
moth
to
a
dead
leaf
;
*
that
the
powerful
vision
of
a
predaceous
bird
should
be
utterly
unable
to
detect
a
sitting
bird
on
account
of
her
subdued
colouring
,
or
Iier
uest
because
its
walls
were
decked
with
lichen
.
That
mimicry
does
exist
we
know
;
that
it
renders
objects
less
conspicuous
to
the
uninterested
onlooker
,
and
,
therefore
,
may
be
iu
a
measure
protective
,
is
probable
;
but
that
it
exists
with
any
definite
intention
,
is
no
more
than
a
guess
.
Lord
Lilford
's
view
as
to
the
site
usually
selected
for
the
nest
of
the
Reed
Bunting
coincides
with
my
own
limited
experience
,
for
he
says
:
—
"
All
the
nests
which
we
have
met
with
were
situated
on
the
ground
,
or
the
crust
formed
by
the
roots
of
the
common
reed
.
"
Hewitson
,
however
,
in
the
third
edition
of
his
"
Eggs
of
British
Birds
,
"
observes
:
—
I
have
,
though
rarely
,
found
them
at
an
elevation
of
two
feet
or
more
above
the
water
,
and
supported
by
a
branch
of
the
common
reed
,
not
fixed
like
the
nest
of
the
Reed- Warbler
,
attached
to
the
pcipcii
-
diciday
stciiis
,
but
supported
upon
a
bunch
of
them
which
had
been
prostrated
by
the
wind
.
"
Sometimes
the
nest
is
placed
in
young
spruce
firs
,
and
it
is
often
found
iu
herbage
on
a
bank
.
The
materials
of
the
nest
seem
to
vary
considerably
;
all
mine
are
formed
of
fine
dead
grasses
and
a
few
bents
,
or
coarser
bents
with
a
blade
or
two
of
broad-grass
;
and
are
lined
with
very
fine
grass
and
horsehairs
,
or
fine
grass
alone
.
Stevenson
's
nests
seem
to
have
been
formed
of
fine
bents
and
lined
with
the
feathery
tops
of
reeds
.
Lord
Lilford
's
were
composed
of
moss
and
sedge
,
with
a
lining
of
reed
tops
,
and
sometimes
a
little
hair
.
Seebohm
mentions
withered
leaves
of
rushes
as
one
of
the
materials
employed
,
and
Howard
Saunders
speaks
of
withered
flags
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
and
are
of
various
stone
tints
var^dng
between
pale
brownish-lavender
and
olivaceous-buff
;
blotched
,
spotted
,
speckled
,
and
often
more
or
less
boldly
streaked
with
purplish-black
,
the
ixnderlying
spots
appearing
a
lavender-grey
:
they
have
the
opaque
appearance
characteristic
of
eggs
of
the
Chaffinch
,
but
more
nearly
resemble
one
variety
of
those
of
the
Tree
Pipit
.
The
nesting-season
usually
commences
late
in
April
or
early
in
May
,
though
Lord
Lilford
mentions
having
taken
a
full
nest
as
early
as
March
23rd
,
and
as
from
two
to
three
broods
are
reared
,
nidification
must
continue
until
at
least
the
end
of
July
,
if
not
to
the
middle
of
August
.
It
has
been
stated
that
the
male
takes
part
in
incubating
the
eggs
,
but
I
have
not
had
sufficient
experience
of
this
species
to
be
able
to
dogmatise
on
the
point
.
As
a
rule
it
is
engaged
in
singing
its
poor
song
,
while
the
hen
sits
near
by
;
and
when
the
nest
is
dis-↵covered
both
birds
try
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
intruder
by
tumbling
about
,
as
if
wounded
upon
the
earth
.
The
song
consists
of
a
few
monotonous
notes
cheo
,
chco
,
cheo
,
chcc
,
chce
,
chcc
,
chee
,
and
terminates
with
a
harsh
zshivec
;
the
call-↵note
is
said
to
be
tsclicc
,
and
Mr.
Witchell
states
that
he
has
heard
another
note
,
resembling
the
cr}^
of
the
Chaffinch
.
The
food
consists
chiefly
of
insects
,
their
larvse
,
and
small
mollusca
in
snmmer
,
but
of
seeds
in
winter
:
in
confinement
,
however
,
very
little
insect
food
is
necessary
to
keep
this
bird
in
health
.
In
October
,
1888
,
I
purchased
my
first
male
Reed-↵Bunting
from
a
catcher
.
I
turned
it
into
my
largest
covered
aviary
,
where
it
lived
a
perfectly
inoffensive
,
though
stupid
and
absolutely
silent
life
until
1891
;
the
winter
following
the
death
of
this
bird
my
man
caught
a
second
(
in
company
with
Skylarks
)
which
also
lived
about
three
years
,
dying
before
its
spring
change
of
plumage
,
whilst
a
third
example
was
given
to
me
and
died
more
quickly
.
Not
one
of
these
three
birds
ever
uttered
the
slightest
sound
,
nor
have
others
which
I
have
owned
more
recentl3^
and
although
fairly
tame
they
all
showed
a
skulking
disposition
,
rarely
appearing
in
the
open
part
of
the
aviary
excepting
to
feed
,
and
showing
none
of
that
somewhat
sprightly
activity
which
characterizes
this
species
in
its
wild
state
.
As
an
aviary
bird
,
I
can
,
therefore
,
only
recommend
this
Bunting
on
account
of
its
quiet
beauty
of
plumage
and
absolute
innocence
.

To
Great
Britain
this
species
is
an
occasional
,
though
not
very
infrequent
visitor
;
upwards
of
forty
examples
apparently
having
been
obtained
previous
to
1890
,
since
Selby
first
recognized
the
bird
,
amongst
some
Larks
forwarded
to
Leadenhall
Market
from
Cambridgeshire
,
early
in
1826
.
Since
1890
this
species
has
visited
us
more
frequently
.
In
October
and
November
,
1892
,
J.
H.
Gurney
stated
that
at
least
fifty-six
were
netted
and
shot
in
Norfolk
.
In
the
following
year
considerable
numbers
were
seen
on
the
Lincolnshire
coast
,
a
good
many
were
recorded
as
having
passed
along
the
downs
in
February
.
In
November
of
the
same
year
a
flock
of
from
sixty
to
eighty
was
seen
near
Flaniborough
by
Matthew
Bailey
,
and
later
a
flock
of
from
a
hundred
to
a
hundred
and
twenty
by
J.
Cordeaux
.
In
the
Zoologist
for
1894
,
the
late
Rev
.
H.
A.
Macpherson
stated
that
in
the
southern
counties
a
few
had
been
taken
annually
for
the
past
dozen
years
near
Dover
,
but
that
in
November
,
1893
,
only
three
were
caught
near
Brighton
.
In
1900
Mr.
Patterson
reported
their
annual
occurrence
in
greater
or
less
numbers
in
Norfolk
,
and
occurrences
of
the
species
in
Sussex
,
Warwick
,
Yorkshire
,
Scotland
,
and
Ireland
have
been
recorded
up
to
1907
.
The
male
in
breeding-plumage
has
the
head
,
including
the
throat
,
and
the
breast
velvety-black
;
a
broad
white
superciliary
stripe
extends
backwards
over
the
ear-coverts
,
and
is
continued
downwards
on
the
sides
of
the
neck
;
across
the
back
of
the
neck
is
a
broad
collar
of
bright
chestnut
;
the
remainder
of
the
upper
surface
(
including
the
wing-coverts
and
secondaries
)
is
blackish
,
the
feathers
bordered
with
tawny-buff
,
or
creamy-whitish
;
the
primaries
and
tail-feathers
deep
brown
,
with
narrow
ashy
margins
,
the
two
outer
pairs
of
tail-feathers
with
elon-↵gated
dull
white
patches
on
the
inner
webs
:
remainder
of
under
surface
creamy-↵white
,
with
black
streaks
on
the
flanks
:
beak
yellow
,
tipped
with
black
;
feet
blackish-brown
;
iris
hazel
.
The
feuiale
is
paler
above
and
without
the
defined
collar
on
the
nape
,
the
feathers
of
the
crown
have
tawny-margins
,
and
a
whitish
stripe
runs
down
the
centre
of
the
head
:
the
ear-coverts
are
brown
,
partly
edged
with
blackish
;
the
cheeks
and
under
surface
are
creamy
white
:
a
black
line
run-↵ning
below
the
cheeks
to
the
upper
throat
,
where
the
feathers
are
also
black
,
though
parti}'
concealed
by
broad
whitish
borders
.
After
the
autumn
moult
all
the
feathers
have
pale
tawu}-
borders
,
but
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
the
male
are
not
wholly
lost
.
The
young
nearly
resemble
the
female
,
but
are
mure
tawny
and
more
uniformly
streaked
above
.
There
is
always
a
chance
of
anyone
familiar
with
the
appearance
of
this
species
being
fortunate
enough
to
observe
and
recognize
it
upon
our
coasts
during
the
autumn
or
spring
migrations
:
since
the
completion
of
Howard
Saunders'
Manual
,
numerous
examples
have
been
either
killed
or
noticed
.
Even
as
late
in
the
year
as
the
iith
Ma}-
,
Mr.
John
Cordeaux
(
"
Zoologist
"
1893
,
p.
225
)
observed
an
adult
male
in
full
summer
dress
on
the
short
herbage
on
the
edge
of
the
Bempton
Cliffs
,
iu
Yorkshire
.
Mr.
Cordeaux
,
who
was
accompanied
by
Mr.
M.
Bailey
,
of
Flamborough
,
says
:
—
"
We
both
observed
it
for
some
little
time
through
our
glasses
about
half
a
dozen
yards
awa}-
,
till
it
flew
down
the
cliff-face
amongst
a
crowd
of
Guillemots
and
other
rock
birds
,
and
did
not
after
this
show
itself
again
.
What
particularl}-
struck
me
when
watching
this
bird
was
the
intense
black
of
the
dark
parts
as
contrasted
with
the
yellow
bill
,
broad
white
streak
over
and
backward
from
the
eye
,
and
chestnut
collar
.
"
Judging
from
Seebolim
's
account
of
this
species
it
is
,
as
might
be
expected
,
a
late
breeder
,
he
says
:
—
"
In
the
valley
of
the
Petchora
we
did
not
meet
with
it
at
Ust
Zylma
,
iu
lat
.
66°
,
until
the
i8th
of
May
;
and
in
the
valley
of
the
Yenesay
,
on
the
Koorayika
,
in
lat
.
i
°
,
a
solitary
Lapland
Bunting
appeared
for
the
first
time
on
the
4th
of
June
—
in
each
case
at
least
six
weeks
after
the
arrival
of
the
Snow- Bunting
.
In
both
cases
I
had
an
excellent
opportunity
of
watching
their
habits
.
The
first
birds
to
arrive
were
males
,
principall}'
in
compau}-
with
Shore-↵Larks
;
they
passed
through
on
migration
for
about
a
fortnight
,
the
latter
flocks
being
almost
entirely
composed
of
females
.
They
seem
to
be
entirely
ground-↵feeders
,
and
ran
about
very
actively
wherever
there
was
any
bare
ground
;
but
before
the
snow
had
entirely
disappeared
the
Lapland
Buntings
had
also
taken
their
departure
,
and
we
did
not
meet
with
them
again
until
we
had
passed
the
limit
of
forest
growth
.
On
migration
they
repeatedly
perched
in
trees
,
and
when
disturbed
generally
sought
refuge
in
a
tree
.
Like
the
Shore-Lark
and
the
Snow-↵Bunting
,
the
Lapland
Bunting
occasionally
hops
;
its
flight
is
quick
and
powerful
,
but
more
undulating
than
that
of
the
Snow-Bunting
.
In
its
song
the
Lapland
Bunting
reminds
one
both
of
the
Snow-Bunting
and
the
Tree
Pipit
.
The
notes
are
not
very
loud
,
but
are
musical
,
and
are
continued
for
some
time
;
and
every
now
and
then
a
curious
note
is
introduced
which
sounds
like
chciig
,
the
consonants
,
both
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
,
being
pronounced
gutturall}'
,
as
in
German
.
This
note
is
also
frequently
repeated
alone
,
and
is
probably
the
note
of
endearment
between
the
sexes
.
*
The
song
is
generally'
heard
when
the
bird
is
fl\"ing
in
the
air
,
soaring
like
a
Lark
,
and
is
continued
until
the
bird
alights
on
some
grassy
knoll
or
stunted
bush
,
descending
with
outspread
wings
and
tail
.
What
I
take
to
be
the
alarm-note
of
this
bird
is
a
plaintive
but
loud
iltct'
-up
,
often
heard
near
its
nest
.
The
female
has
a
song
almost
as
rich
as
that
of
the
male
.
The
Laj^land
Bunting
is
not
such
a
coast
bird
as
the
Snow-Bunting
,
and
seeks
the
swampiest
groiind
it
can
find
so
long
as
there
are
dr}'
tussocks
of
grass
full
of
flowers
where
it
can
breed
;
if
there
are
also
a
few
stunted
willows
or
birches
upon
which
it
can
perch
,
so
much
the
better
.
The
nest
is
almost
always
placed
in
some
hole
in
the
side
of
one
of
the
little
mounds
or
tussocks
which
abound
on
the
marsh}-
parts
of
the
tundra
;
it
is
composed
of
dry
grass
and
roots
,
and
profusel}-
lined
with
feathers
.
The
eggs
of
the
Lapland
Bunting
are
from
four
to
six
in
number
,
and
differ
very
much
both
in
size
and
colour
.
They
vary
in
ground-colour
from
pale
gre}'
to
pale
brown
,
more
or
less
obscured
by
a
profusion
of
iinderlying
blotches
and
streaks
,
which
var}'
in
colour
from
yellowish-brown
to
reddish- brown
;
the
overlying
markings
are
generally
much
fewer
,
and
are
principally
streaks
mixed
with
a
few
blotches
and
spots
of
dark
reddish-brown
.

Herr
Gatke
states
that
this
species
,
in
its
character
,
"
is
altogether
unlike
the
Snow-Bunting
,
having
nothing
of
the
boisterousness
and
wilduess
of
that
species
,
but
being
of
a
gentle
and
quiet
disposition
.
Indeed
,
I
have
frequently
for
3'ears
kept
it
confined
in
a
cage
,
and
its
melodious
,
if
somewhat
melanchol}^
,
tune
has
given
me
much
enjoyment
during
many
a
summer
night
spent
at
my
desk
over
these
pages
.
The
song
of
the
Snow- Bunting
has
exactly
the
same
character
;
but
the
melodious
,
flute-like
notes
are
fuller
,
and
the
bird
in
confinement
will
onlj^
give
utterance
to
them
during
the
first
hours
of
June
and
July
nights
.
The
Snow-↵Bunting
remains
,
however
,
so
utterly
intractable
,
crying
like
one
possessed
when
any
person
approaches
its
cage
,
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
friends
with
it
,
and
one
generally
ends
by
once
more
giving
the
peevish
fellow
his
liberty
.
The
Lapland
Bunting
,
on
the
other
hand
,
ceases
fluttering
after
one
or
two
weeks
confinement
if
one
keeps
renewing
its
food
,
and
soon
becomes
so
tame
that
it
will
take
flies
from
the
fingers
.
It
also
invariably
accomplishes
its
autumn
moiilt
to
perfection
,
and
in
a
very
short
time
.

Stevenson
's
experience
of
this
species
as
a
cage-bird
seems
to
have
been
much
the
same
as
Gatke
's
;
he
says
:
—
"
Unlike
most
birds
when
first
confined
in
a
cage
,
it
seemed
perfectly
at
home
,
feeding
readily
on
the
seed
placed
for
it
,
and
both
in
its
gait
and
manner
of
looking
np
,
with
the
neck
stretched
out
,
reminded
me
of
the
actions
of
a
quail
.
In

aviary
of
Air
.
J.
H.
Gurne}-
,
this
bird
assumed
its
full
summer
plumage
in
the
following
spring
,
and
thrived
so
well
in
its
new
abode
,
that
over-feeding
was
probabl}'
the
cause
of
its
death
in
May
,
1856
,
when
for
the
second
time
,
it
had
acquired
the
black
head
and
plumage
of
the
breeding
season
,
and
was
certainl}'
a
perfect
lump
of
fat
when
skinned
for
the
purpose
of
preservation
.

The
food
of
this
species
consists
largely
of
insects
in
the
summer
and
seeds
in
the
winter
;
but
in
confinement
it
should
be
treated
like
the
other
Buntings
.
It
is
undoubtedly
the
most
desirable
of
all
the
British
Buntings
for
the
aviculturist
,
and
should
certainly
be
freely
imported
as
a
cage-bird

further

,
excepting
in
the
Faroe
Islands
and
Shetlands
where
it
places
its
nest
little
above

,
South

,
North

;
and
is
a
rare
,
but
regular
,
winter
visitor

To
Great
Britain
the
Snow-Bunting
is
chiefly
a
winter
visitor
,
generally
reaching
the
eastern
coast
of
England
in
October
,
though
rarely
in
September
,
and
commencing
its
return
migration
from
March
to
April
.
Although
rare
in
England
and
Ireland
,
this
bird
is
decidedly
commoner
in
Scotland
,
where
a
few
pairs
remain
to
breed
:
the
first
nest
being
obtained
in
the
Shetlands
by
Saxb}-
,
on
Juh-
and
,
1 86 1

In

,
1886

Messrs.

found
nest
and
3-oung
in
Sutherlandshire
,
and
in
June
,
1888
,
Mr.
John
Young
discovered
a
nest
with
five
eggs
.
I
believe
it
was
obtained
later
by
Mr.
W.
R.
O
.
Graut
.
In
1903
nests
were
found
on
the
spurs
of
the
Grampians
,
stretching
southwards
between
Raunoch
and
Glen
Lyon
,
and
in
1905
on
a
mountain
still
further
south
.
The
adult
male
in

has
the
mantle
,
scapulars
,
inner
second-↵aries
,
terminal
half
of
primaries
,
lour
central
tail-feathers
and
greater
part

mostly
white
;
centre

but
the
sides
white
;
remainder
of

white

The

the
plumage
grej'er
,

with
pale
edges
to
the

,
the

mottled
with

.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
feathers
of
the
upper
surface
,
breast
,
and
flanks
are
bordered
with
dull
chestnut
,
which
gradually
changes
to
white
during
the

,
and
the

becomes
orange-ochreous
tipped
with
blackish
.
The
young
are
greyish
,
with
dark
centres
to
most
of
the
feathers
,
but
the
wings

resembling

adults
.
This
bird
has
received
many
trivial
names
,
such
as—
The
Lesser
Pied
Mountain
Finch
,
The
Snow-bird
from
Hudson
's
Bay
,
The
Tawny
Bunting
,
The
IMountain
Bnnting
,
The
Lorraiu
Bunting
;
but
its
prettiest
name
(
and
that
by
which
it
is
almost
as
well-known
as
Snow- Bunting
)
is
Snow-flake
.
Seebohm
writes
respecting
the
habits
of
this
bird
as
follows
:
—
"
The
flight
of
the
Snow-Bunting
is
peculiar
,
and
is
something
like
that
of
a
butterfly
,
as
if
the
bird
altered
its
mind
ever}'
few
seconds
as
to
which
direction
it
wished
to
take
.
It
can
scarcely
be
called
an
undulating
flight
.
The
bird
certainly
does
rest
its
wings
every
few
seconds
;
but
either
they
are
expanded
when
at
rest
,
or
they
are
rested
for
so
short
a
time
that
the
plane
of
flight
is
not
sufficiently
altered
to
warrant
its
being
called
undulating
.
The
Snow-Bunting
is
almost
entirely
a
ground-feeder
,
and
is
consequently
continually
seen
on
the
ground
.
These
birds
run
along
the
snow
with
the
celerity
of
a
Wagtail
on
a
sand-bank
;
but
the}-
can
hop
as
easily
as
a
Sparrow
,
and
I
have
very
often
seen
them
do
so
.
The
idea
that
they
seldom
or
never
perch
on
trees
is
a
mistake
,
which
has
no
doubt
arisen
from
the
circumstance
that
on
the
steppes
,
where
they
delight
to
winter
,
and
on
the
tundra
,
where
the}'
breed
,
there
are
no
trees
.
In
the
valley
of
the
Petchora
,
we
had
abundant
opportunity
of
seeing
them
in
trees
.

Lord
Lilford
observes
:
—
"
In
the
few
instances
in
which
,
*
*
*
*
^
^ve
met
with
this
bird
in
the
highlands
of
Inverness-shire
,
we
found
it
exceedingly
tame
,
running
about
within
a
few
yards
of
us
,
and
feeding
on
the
seeds
of
varions
grasses
which
grew
by
the
burn-sides
;
in
one
instance
the
bird
was
so
confiding
that
I
nearly-
caught
it
with
my
cap
;
but
this
was
no
doubt
caused
by
the
fact
that
a
Merlin
was
huntiug
over
the
moss
at
the
moment
when
the
'
Snow-flake
,
'
as
this
bird
is
often
called
,
fluttered
up
at
our
feet
.
The
call-note
of
this
species
is
pleasing
and
musical
,
and
the
male
has
an
agreeable
song
,
which
,
however
,
I
have
only
heard
from
a
caged
bird
.
In
captivity
the
Snow-Bunting
will
eat
almost
any
sort
of
seed

says
:
—

be

how
apllj^
the
term

been
applied
to
the
species

I
am
acquainted

no

that
afforded

The
uidification
of
the
Snow- Bunting
is
late
;
most
nests
being
apparently
obtainable
in
June
and
July
,
although
in
Iceland
it
nests
as
earl}'
as
May
;
it
chooses
heaps
of
stones
,
crevices
in
rocks
or
behind
boulders
,
or
piles
of
drift-↵wood
in
which
to
build
.
The
nest
is
bulky
and
constructed
of
dr}'
grass
,
rootlets
,
sometimes
birch
or
other
twigs
,
and
a
little
moss
:
it
is
lined
with
down
,
hair
,
and
a
cpiantity
of
feathers
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
eight
;
six
or
seven
being
(
according
to
Seebohm
)
a
iisual
clutch
.
Both
in
size
and
colouring
they
vary
considerabl}'
,
the
ground-↵colour
being
creamy
or
greyish-white
,
or
pale
greenish
,
spotted
and
blotched
with
chocolate
,
and
occasionally
striated
with
blackish
;
the
shell-markings
are
pale
reddish-brown
and
lavender
;
most
of
the
markings
are
usually
collected
towards
or
at
the
larger
extremity
.
The
food
during
the
breeding-season
consists
largely
of
insects
,
but
at
other
times
all
kinds
of
seed
are
eaten
,
as
well
as
corn
.
John
Cordeaux
says
(
Birds
of
the
Humber
District
)
:
—
"
The
little
Snow-flake
will
find
food
and
thrive
in
the
severest
winters
,
after
all
our
small
feathered
friends
have
been
driven
by
frost
and
snow
from
the
cold
and
exposed
marshes
,
feeding
on
the
seeds
of
various
grasses
picked
from
the
withered
bents
rising
above
the
carpet
of
snow
.
They
are
nearly
always
excessively
fat
.
"
"
Roosts
generally
amongst
rough
grass
on
the
pastures
.
"
During
incubation
,
the
male
bird
is
in
full
soug
,
its
notes
being
heard
both
when
perched
or
fluttering
in
the
air
,
like
a
Tree
Pipit
:
the
song
is
described
as
a
melodious
warble
,
similar
to
that
of
the
Lapland
Bunting
and
Shore-Lark
;
when
flocks
of
this
and
other
species
are
fl^'ing
together
they
are
said
to
twitter
after
the
manner
of
other
Finches
;
the
alarm
note
is
described
as
a
loud
fivcck
,
and
the
bird
has
another
note
resembling
the
harsh
zslnveco
of
the
Greenfinch
and
Brambling
,
but
Lord
Lilford
's
observations*
prove
that
this
is
not
the
call-note
;
it
is
more
probably
a
note
of
defiance
:
indeed
Saxby
probably
means
this
note
in
his
description
of
"
the
sudden
jarring
sound
which
is
uttered
by
the
bird
when
suddenly
directing
its
course
towards
a
neighbour
.
That
the
note
in
question
is
sometimes
one
of
anger
I
have
repeatedly
observed
when
two
of
the
birds
have
been
quarrelling
over
their
food
.

As
a
cage-bird
,
the
Snow-Bunting
,
in
spite
of
Herr
Gatke
's
adverse
estimate
,
is
pretty
generally
admired
;
and
is
very
frequently'
exhibited
at
shows
.
Stevenson
's
opinion
of
the
species
certainly
differed
widely
from
that
of
the
veteran
of
Heligo-↵land
,
for
he
says
:
—
"
In
confinement
,
I
have
found
the
Snow-Buntings
very
gentle
in
disposition
and
extremely
affectionate
to
one
another
,
forming
an
amiable
contrast
in
both
respects
to
the
Brambling
Finches
.
A
pair
,
which
were
kindly
sent
me
for
my
aviary
in
1862
,
b}'
Mr.
Fowler
,
of
Gnnton
,
near
Lowestoft
,
netted
from
a
very
large
number
at
that
time
frequenting
the
Gorton
beach
,
attained
very
nearl}-
their
full
summer
plumage
,
their
beaks
also
,
which
are
yellow
in
winter
,
assuming
a
dark
leaden
tint
.
Both
these
birds
,
unfortunately
,
suffered
from
a
diseased
state
of
the
feet
,
which
were
painfully
swollen
,
and
the
scutella
on
the
anterior
portion
of
the
tarsi
and
toes
were
greatly
enlarged
and
ragged
.
With
this
exception
,
the}'
lived
in
apparently
good
health
till
the
autumn
of
1863
,
when
the
female
wasted
away
and
died
,
and
the
male
survived
his
partner
only

"
It
is
certain
that
the
Snow-Bunting
ought
not
to
be
restricted
to
a
cage
,
unless
it
be
a
ver}'
large
one
:
half
the
charm
of
this
beautiful
species
consists
in
seeing
it
fly
:
moreover
it
is
only
to
be
expected
that
a
bird
accustomed
to
wander
over
some
of
the
wildest
regions
of
the
earth
and
sea
,
should
feel
stunned
and
miserable
when
confined
within
narrow
limits
and
constantly
subjected
to
inspection
in
a
stuff}'
room
.
An
out-door
aviary
would
be
the
most
suitable
home
for
it
,
and
the
larger
the
better
.
Swaysland
indeed
states
that
"
as
it
is
a
somewhat
dull
bird
,
it
is
not
desirable
for
either
cage
or
aviary
,
"
and
others
have
told
me
that
it
makes
a
stupid
cage-bird
;
but
Swaysland
gives
no
details
;
indeed
his
account
of
the
species
inclines
one
to
the
belief
that
he
is
not
speaking
from
personal
experience
:
in
any
case
its
song
should
atone
for
everything
,
for
Captain
H.
W.
Fieldeu
(

iu
a
paper
on
the
birds
of
the
North
PoLar
Basiu
,
says
:
—
"
Ou
the
13th
May
,
1876
,
I
heard
the
first
Suow-Buuting-
fPlectropliauis

)
as
we
lay
in
onr
tent
on
the
floe
at
the
base
of
a
cliff
.
The
note
came
from
above
,
clear
and
musical
,
and
each
inmate
of
the
tent
started
into
a
postnre
,
and
said
Hnsh
,
hnsh
,
do
yon
hear
it
?
'
One
of
the
sailors
said
to
me
,
'
What
bird
is
that
sir
?
it
is
sweeter
than
a
throstle
.
IMy
friend
Mr.
David
Seth-Smith
had
a
pair
for
a
considerable
time
and
may
perhaps
still
have
them
;
I
have
seen
them
flying
about
iu
one
of
his

times

never
heard
the

FAMILY
vSTURNID^
.
THE
Starlings
are
an
Old
World
family
of
birds
linked
to
the
Finches
through
the
hicridcr
or
Troupials
and
Cow-birds
of
the
New
World
;
but
,
ou
the
other
hand
,
showing
affinity
to
the
Corvida
or
Crow-family
.
They
are
character-↵ized
by
a
long
straight
slender
bill
,
with
the
nostrils
placed
low
down
,
without
rictal
bristles
;
a
very
small
bastard
primary
aud
very
loug
second
primary
;
the
tarsus
is
scaled
in
front
,
but
uot
behind
.
Starlings
wlieu
on
the
ground
progress
in
a
purposeless
,
irregular
fashion
,
mostly
by
walking
or
running
;
on
the
wing
their
flight
is
powerful
,
but
peculiar
,
so
that
,
wheu
at
a
great
height
,
it
has
a
twinkling
appearance
;
when
at
a
lower
elevation
this
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
they
rapidly
flap
their
somewhat
long
wings
aud
then
sail
straight
forwards
.
These
birds
are
practically
omnivorous
,
always
hungr}'
and
consequentl}-
large
feeders
;
they
are
,
therefore
,
unsuitable
for
caged
pets
,
unless
considerable
attention
can
be
paid
to
them
by
their
owners
:
in
themselves
,
however
,
they
are
cleanly
,
being
exceedingly
fond
of
bathing
.
The
songs
of
Starlings
are
either
altogether
,
or
partly
,
harsh
iu
character
;
iu
which
respect
aud
in
their
powers
of
mimicry
,
they
somewhat
resemble
their
allies
the
Crows
.
Like
the
latter
also
they
soon
become
tame
and
confiding
iu
captivity
;
in
which
respect
they
widely
differ
from
some
of
the
Ictcridcc
which
never
seem
to
get
the
least
bit
tamer
after
j^ears
of
confinement
iu
an
aviary
,
and
always
remain
nervous
in
a
cage
;
the
species
of
the
genus
Ictcyus
,
however
,
are
marvellously
tame
birds
.
In
one
respect
,
in
addition
to
their
general
outline
,
the
true
Starlings
resemble
the
so-called
"
Meadow-Starlings
"
;
they
are
very
gregarious
.
In
their
nidification
the
Stuiiiidcc
as
a
rule
differ
both
from
the
Icki tdcc
and
Coivida
;
building
their
nests
of
all
kinds
of
rubbish
,
in
holes
or
crevices
of
trees
,
banks
,
rocks
,
walls
,
or
buildings
:
their
eggs
are
uniform
in
colouring
and
usually
greenish-blue
;
but
both
in
the
Stuniidcc
and
Icicrida
there
are
exceptions
to
this
broad
distinction
.
No
birds
are
so
easy
to
capture
as
Starlings
,
nets
and
traps
awaken
no
suspicion
of
danger
in
their
unreflecting
brains
;
they
see
food
,
and
rush
in
helter-skelter
to
secure
it
;
so
that
a
small
trap
will
sometimes
secure
from
three
to
five
at
one
fall
.

Sfitniiis

LiNN
.
GENERALLY
distributed
over
the
greater
part
of
Europe
,
breeding
as
far
to
the
south
as
Northern
Ital}'
.
The
European
birds
which
migrate
,
pass
the
winter
in
the
south
of
France
,
Portugal
,
Spain
,
Ital}'
,
Greece
,
Northern
Africa
and
Palestine
.
The
Asiatic
birds
breed
in
Southern
Siberia
,
Persia
,
Turkestan
,
and
eastward
to
the
Amur
:
they
winter
in
India
,
passing
through
Mongolia
on
migration
.
In
Great
Britain
the
Starling
is
partially
resident
and
generall}-
distributed
throughout
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
;
in
the
latter
island
it
used
to
be
rather
local
in
the
breeding-season
,
but
it
now
nests
in
every
county
;
in
Cornwall
and
Wales
it
was
somewhat
rare
at
that
season
,
now
it
is
ever3'where
abuudaut
iu
North
Wales
.
In
Scotland
,
where
it
nsed
to
be
b}'
no
means
abundant
,
excepting
in
some
of
the
islands
,
it
is
now
very
commou
in
uearh'
every
count}'
.
The
adult
male
in
Ijreeding
-plumage
is
glossy
black
,
brightly
shot
with
metallic
green
,
rosy-violet
,
and
Prussian
blue
,
the
rosy
and
purplish
tints
being
usually
most
prevalent
on
the
head
,
nape
,
mantle
,
and
breast
;
the
bluer
feathers
varying
iu
certain
lights
to
Prussian
green
:
the
feathers
of
the
upper
surface
,
e.xceptiug
the
head
and
fore-neck
,
tipped
with
dead
gold
,
or
sandy
buff
;
flights
and
tail-↵feathers
dark
smoky-brown
,
bordered
with
black
,
and
edged
with
sandy-buff
;
thighs
and
under
tail-coverts
blackish
,
the
latter
with
broad
buff
margins
:
bill
lemon-↵yellow
;
feet
reddish-brown
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
is
less
metallic
than
the
male
and
has
larger
buff
tips
to
the
feathers
,
the
under
surface
of
the
body
being
more
or
less
spotted
throughout
the
year
;
the
bill
is
also
blackish
towards
the
tip
.
After
the
autumn
moult
all
the
feathers
of
the
upper
parts
are
broadly
tipped
with
sandj'
-buff
;
the
wing- feathers
are
gre3-er
;
and
the
sides
of
the
face
and
under
surface
are
more
or
less
conspicuousl}'
spotted
with
white
:
*
the
bill
also
becomes
partly
,
or
altogether
,
dark
brown
.
The
young
are
greyish-brown
,
the
quill
and
tail-feathers
margined
with
pale
brown
,
and
the
feathers
of
the
imder
parts
with
whitish
margins
.
There
is
considerable
difference
iu
the
metallic
colouring
of
individual
Starlings
:
the
example
which
I
have
noted
below
,
as
being
heavily
white-spotted
in
winter
,
used
to
develop
the
most
brilliant
violet
on
neck
and
breast
in
the
breeding-season
;
the
blue
and
green
tints
were
also
very
bright
;
whilst
the
buff
markings
above
had
a
well-defined
golden
gloss
:
indeed
,
the
whole
bird
appeared
as
if
formed
out
of
burnished
metal
.
Wherever
the
House-Sparrow
is
,
one
ma}'
be
pretty
certain
to
meet
with
the
Starling
either
iu
town
or
country
:
it
is
a
bird
which
is
always
conspicuous
,
whether
on
the
wing
or
on
the
ground
:
in
spring
one
sees
a
dozen
or
more
flying
round
a
Rook
,
regularly
mobbing
him
as
he
carries
home
some
grub
to
his
callow
young
,
until
in
his
fright
he
drops
the
dainty
morsel
and
down
go
the
Starlings
with
much
noise
to
quarrel
over
it
;
later
the
tables
are
turned
,
the
Starling
as
it
carries
food
to
its
young
being
similarly
tormented
by
Sparrows
.
Now
one
sees
the
male
bird
sitting
high
up
on
some
naked
branch
,
on
a
chimney-↵pot
,
or
the
corner
of
a
gable
,
discoursing
what
he
evidentl}-
considers
sweet
music
.
Marvellous
is
the
song
of
a
Starling
!
a
curious
combination
of
whistling
,
squeaking
,
gargling
,
and
the
sucking
hiss
made
by
pulling
out
the
handle
of
a
brass
garden
squirt
:
a
few
of
the
whistled
notes
are
clear
,
and
the
song
,
if
not
melodious
,
is
at
any
rate
comical
enough
to
be
not
unpleasant
:
moreover
the
energy
which
the
bird
puts
into
the
performance
is
ridiculous
;
his
head
is
some-↵what
retracted
,
the
feathers
of
crown
and
throat
all
somewhat
raised
,
his
bill
wide
open
,
his
wings
quivering
,
and
his
whole
body
shaking
.
As
the
late
Mr.
Witchell
observes
:
"
In
earl}'
spring
the
phrases
of
the
Starling
are
concluded
with
a
harsh
squealing
cry
.
"
He
tells
us
that
he
has
heard
about
half-a-dozen
of
these
birds
singing
the
following
phrase
in
chorus
;
that
the
intervals
were
fairly
correct
.
and
the
unison
was
seemingly
perfect
:
he
says
that
one
bird
commenced
the
phrase
with
the
first
two
notes
and
then
the
others
joined
in
.
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
ever
had
a
similar
experience
;
but
then
I
have
not
had
the
musical
training
which
Mr.
Witchell
had
received
.
The
warning-cry
of
the
Starling
is
a
cali
,
not
unlike
that
of
a
rook
,
but
the
cry
of
terror
is
a
harsh
shrieking
;
then
there
is
a
prolonged
reed}-
whistle
,
apparentl}'
a
note
of
excitement
,
only
heard
in
the
spring
;
and
lastly
there
is
the
call
of
the
male
bird
to
his
mate
:
—
Joey
dcc-ur
Iicc-ur
(
the
hcc
ver}'
much
prolonged
)
.
*
The
cry
of
the
j'oung
for
food
is
very
loud
and
harsh
.
The
nest
is
placed
in
any
hole
in
a
tree
,
a
bank
,
a
cutting
,
a
sand-
or
chalk-↵pit
,
a
rock
,
wall
,
ruin
,
chimney
,
in
thatches
,
or
roofing
of
summer-houses
,
cottages
,
and
out-houses
,
in
stove-
or
gutter-pipes
.
It
is
roughly
constructed
of
grass
or
straw
,
sometimes
with
a
lining
of
wool
and
a
few
feathers
,
and
usually
contains
from
four
to
six
eggs
,
though
sometimes
only
three
,
smooth
and
somewhat
glossy
and
beautifull}'
oval
;
always
unspotted
,
but
varying
in
tint
from
bluish-white
to
turquoise-blue
;
an
intermediate
shade
between
these
extremes
being
the
commonest
type
.
In
my
"
Handbook
of
British
Oology
"
I
have
described
a
curious
nest
which
I
took
from
the
stove-pipe
to
a
conservatory
at
the
village
of
Upchurch
,
near
Newington
,
Kent
,
and
which
filled
no
less
than
twelve
feet
of
4-incli
piping
:
we
took
the
latter
to
pieces
and
pushed
the
nest
out
in
form
of
a
long
cylinder
.
This
nest
was
entirely
constructed
of
fragments
of
straw
or
bast
,
with
a
few
long
pieces
at
the
sides
,
and
had
been
collected
since
the
arrival
of
mild
weather
and
the
consequent
disuse
of
the
stove
.
It
contained
three
partly
incubated
eggs
,
which
were
about
a
foot
from
the
top
of
the
pipe
.
I
do
not
believe
that
,
if
hatched
,
the
three
young
birds
would
have
beeu
able
to
sit
comfortably
in
the
pipe
,
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
the_v
could
have
easil}-
escaped
from
it
.
Nidification
lasts
from
April
to
June
;
in
mild
seasons
the
first
nests
being
commenced
towards
the
end
of
March
;
two
broods
are
sometimes
reared
in
a
year
,
and
it
is
not
very
rare
to
find
two
hens
in
charge
of
one
nest
,
in
which
case
seven
,
eight
,
or
even
more
eggs
will
be
found
together
:
*
this
I
have
proved
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
but
only
in
the
case
of
nests
built
under
thatching
,
where
I
flushed
both
hens
from
the
same
hole
,
as
I
rested
m}-
ladder
against
the
roof
,
and
putting
in
my
hand
felt
the
whole
of
the
double
clutch
in
the
one
depression
:
so
far
as
I
could
make
out
,
onlj-
one
male
owned
the
nest
and
its
two
occupants
.
The
food
of
the
Starling
consists
during
the
breeding-season
of
worms
,
slugs
,
leather-jackets
(
the
larvae
of
crane-flies
)
and
many
other
destructive
grubs
;
also
of
spiders
and
various
insects
;
indeed
these
are
always
eaten
when
procurable
,
but
in
autumn
fruit
and
the
softer
berries
are
devoured
,
whilst
in
winter
hips
and
haws
,
and
seeds
of
many
kinds
,
as
well
as
all
kinds
of
household
scraps
are
greedily
swallowed
.
In
the
autumn
Starlings
collect
into
immense
flocks
,
consisting
of
hundreds
of
thousands
,
if
not
millions
of
individuals
;
as
they
pass
overhead
,
wheeling
in
an
immense
circle
,
the
sound
of
their
wings
is
like
the
rushing
of
water
,
and
the
earth
is
darkened
below
as
by
a
heav}^
passing
cloud
.
I
have
seen
two
or
three
of
these
vast
assemblages
following
one
another
and
wheeling
incessantly
over
a
large
park
in
Kent
;
and
,
when
at
length
they
drew
out
into
a
long
continuous
belt
and
gradually
settled
,
the
trees
were
black
with
birds
.
In
captivity
the
Starling
rapidly
becomes
friendly
and
is
always
amusing
,
but
he
is
a
ravenous
bird
with
a
powerful
digestion
,
and
,
therefore
,
needs
constant
attention
if
kept
in
a
cage
:
an
aviary
is
the
place
in
which
to
see
him
to
perfec-↵tion
:
there
he
is
always
perfect
in
plumage
excepting
when
moulting
,
for
he
is
constantly
bathing
and
preening
his
feathers
.
I
reared
my
first
nest
of
young
Starlings
in
May
,
1887
,
feeding
them
on
a
moistened
mixture
of
oat-flour
and
pea-meal
:
thej'
were
no
trouble
to
rear
,
but
very
noisy
,
greedy
,
and
quarrelsome
.
When
full
grown
one
of
these
birds
used
to
spend
nearly
the
whole
day
in
turning
back-somersaults
from
the
top
perch
of
his
cage
to
the
bottom
one
,
or
to
the
floor
,
and
back
again
:
I
used
to
wonder
whether
it
had
a
diseased
brain
,
but
it
seemed
quite
sensible
in
other
respects
:
another
of
these
birds
distinguished
itself
b}-
singing
incessantlj'
right
up
to
November
:
its
performance
consisted
of
a
comical
jumble
of
chuckling
sounds
,
mixed
with
a
few
Canary
notes
and
the
alarm-chatter
of
the
Blackbird
:
it
also
clever!}-
imitated
the
gutteral
uute
of
the
Missel-Thrush
.
Unless
they
are
required
for
training
,
it
is
better
to
catch
than
to
rear
Starlings
,
selecting
brightly
coloured
males
,
close-feathered
,
with
long
snake-like
neck
and
head
,
and
generally
slender
bod}'
:
these
are
really
the
best
birds
,
although
they
rarely
win
at
shows
unless
kept
warm
and
forced
before
their
time
into
summer
plumage
.
Most
judges
of
British
birds
ignore
torm
,
being
simply
attracted
by
bright
colouring
.

OF
the
geographical
distribution
of
this
bird
,
Seebohm
says
:
—
"
It
breeds
more
or
less
regularly
in
Asia
Minor
and
on
the
western
shores
of
the
Black
Sea
.
The
most
westerly
recorded
instance
of
its
breeding
in
large
numbers
is
in
Lombardy
.
At
Villafranca
,
near
Verona
,
in
1875
,
great
numbers
bred
in
the
castle
,
having
followed
in
the
wake
of
a
flight
of
locusts
.
They
have
not
been
known
to
breed
in
Palestine
;
but
Tristram
describes
enormous
numbers
passing
through
on
their
spring
migration
.
Eastwards
they
breed
in
South
Russia
and
the
Caucasus
,
Turkestan
,
and
South
Siberia
,
as
far
east
as
Lake
Saisan
.
They
have
been
observed
in
North-west
Persia
and
Afghanistan
in
spring
.
They
winter
in
India
in
enormous
numbers
,
and
are
occasionally
found
as
far
south
as
Ceylon
.
The
most
easterly
locality
recorded
of
this
bird
is
the
Andaman
Islands
,
where
flocks
were
seen
by
Col.
Tytler
,
in
January
(
"
Ibis
,
"
1867
,
p
,
331
)
.
At
this
season
of
the
}ear
,
and
on
the
spring
and
autumn
migrations
,
they
have
occurred
in
almost
every
country
of
Europe
,
from
Spain
in
the
west
to
Sweden
in
the
north
,
and
have
been
known
to
stray
as
far
south
as
North
Africa
,
one
or
two
examples
having
been
recorded
from
Egypt
and
Algeria
.
"
In
Great
Britain
the
first
recorded
specimen
\vas
killed
at
Norwood
,
in
Surrey
,
and
was
described
in
1743
;
since
then
it
lias
been
met
with
in
almost
ever}'
count}-
;
the
latest
occurrences
being
of
one
observed
on
an
apple-tree
at
Greatham
,
near
Liss
,
in
Hampshire
,
on
Ma}'
4th
,
1896
,
and
secured
by
its
observer
(
\'ide
Zoologist
,
1896
,
p.
382
)
,
three
in
Ireland
and
one
in
Scill}-
in
1899
,
one
in
Kent
and
another
in
Yorkshire
in
1901
,
one
iu
Shetland
in
1903
,
and
five
or
six
in
1906
.
The
male
in
breeding-plumage
has
the
head
,
neck
,
and
breast
glossy
purplish
black
;
the
wings
including
the
coverts
,
the
tail
and
coverts
of
both
surfaces
glossy
greenish-black
,
and
the
remainder
of
both
surfaces
pale
salmon-rose
;
the
bill
is
also
rose-coloured
,
but
more
orange
towards
the
base
,
which
is
blackish
;
the
feet
brown
;
iris
bright
brown
.
The
female
is
altogether
duller
,
and
has
a
somewhat
smaller
crest
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
black
feathers
are
tipped
with
greyish-↵brown
,
and
the
rosy
feathers
with
dusky
brown
,
the
crest
being
also
undeveloped
;
but
a
gradual
change
takes
place
in
the
spring
.
The
young
are
very
similar
to
adults
in
winter
plumage
,
but
show
no
trace
of
black
or
rose-colour
on
the
feathers
,
their
wing-
and
tail-feathers
have
buff
edges
;
the
bill
is
browner
,
and
the
feet
are
more
flesh-tinted
.
Like
the
common
Starling
this
bird
is
eminently
gregarious
in
its
habits
.
Jerdon
observes
that
"
it
usualh-
makes
its
appearance
in
the
Deccan
and
Carnatic
about
November
,
associating
in
vast
flocks
,
and
committing
great
devastations
on
the
grain
fields
,
more
especially
on
those
of
the
Cholum
or
Jowaree
(
Andropogoii
soy ah us y
;
he
then
quotes
the
following
from
Mr.
Elliot
's
manuscript
notes
:
—
"
Is
very
voracious
and
injurious
to
the
crops
of
white
Jowaree
,
in
the
fields
of
which
the
farmer
is
obliged
to
station
numerous
watchers
,
who
,
with
slings
and
a
long
rope
or
thong
,
which
they
crack
dexterously
,
making
a
loud
report
,
endeavour
to
drive
the
depredators
away
.
The
moment
the
sun
appears
above
the
horizon
they
are
on
the
wing
,
and
at
the
same
instant
shouts
,
cries
,
and
the
cracking
of
the
long
whips
,
resound
from
every
side
.
The
Tillyers
,
however
,
are
so
active
that
if
they
are
able
to
alight
on
the
stalks
for
an
instant
,
they
can
pick
out
several
grains
.
About
9
or
10
o'clock
a.m.
,
the
exertions
of
the
watchmen
cease
,
and
the
Tillyers
do
not
renew
their
plundering
till
evening
.
After
sunset
they
are
seen
in
flocks
of
many
thousands
retiring
to
the
trees
and
jungles
for
the
night
.
They
prefer
the
half
ripe
Jowaree
whilst
the
farinaceous
matter
is
still
soft
and
milky
.
"
It
must
not
,
however
,
be
supposed
that
the
Rose-coloured
Pastor
is
altogether
injurious
to
agriculture
:
on
the
contrary
it
does
good
service
by
its
wholesale
destruction
of
locusts
and
other
noxious
insects
.
Seebohm
gives
the
following
account
of
it
in
his
History
of
British
Birds
:
—
"
In
driving
across
the
steppes
between
the
Danube
and
the
Black
Sea
we
now
and
then
came
upon
small
ilocks
of
these
birds
.
At
a
distance
they
are
indistinguishable
from
common
Starlings
;
tliey
run
along
the
ground
in
the
same
way
,
they
have
the
same
rapid
straight
flight
,
and
the
same
habit
of
clustering
together
.
On
the
ground
they
feed
with
the
same
eager
anxiety
,
but
frequently
perch
on
the
stunted
bushes
,
when
their
pink
colour
is
very
conspicuous
.
The
notes
of
this
bird
are
almost
exactly
the
same
as
those
of
the
Starling
,
they
chatter
together
in
the
same
way
,
and
in
confinement
the
low
warble
mixed
with
the
chatter
is
ver}-
similar
in
both
species
.
In
most
places
where
this
bird
breeds
it
is
protected
on
account
of
the
enormous
number
of
locusts
it
devours
.
In
autumn
it
takes
its
toll
on
the
fruit
(
mulberries
,
cherries
,
etc
.
)
;
but
its
usefulness
in
spring
is
so
apparent
,
that
the
Greeks
and
Turks
do
not
begrudge
it
so
small
a
trifle
.
In
Asia
Minor
,
as
in
the
Dobrudscha
,
I
had
the
misfortune
to
arrive
the
day
after
the
fair
.
Dr.
Kriiper
and
I
were
informed
by
our
friend
Guido
von
Gonzenbach
that
the
Rose-coloured
Starlings
had
bred
in
the
previous
spring
(
1871
)
in
enormous
numbers
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Smyrna
,
and
had
devoured
the
grubs
and
locusts
to
the
admiration
of
the
peasantry
.
"
The
nest
of
the
Rose-coloured
Starling
is
built
in
holes
or
crevices
in
rocks
,
heaps
of
stones
,
earth-cliffs
,
c^uarries
,
walls
,
and
old
ruins
,
and
is
said
to
be
strongly
constructed
,
not
unlike
that
of
a
Blackbird
;
but
at
times
a
mere
accumulation
of
sticks
,
straws
,
and
various
dead
plants
,
with
a
central
depression
for
the
eggs
lined
with
plant
fibre
,
leaves
,
moss
,
and
feathers
.
The
eggs
number
from
five
to
six
,
and
are
glossy
white
with
the
faintest
bluish
tinge
.
This
species
appears
to
be
single-brooded
;
the
hen
is
a
close
sitter
and
is
fed
upon
the
nest
by
the
male
bird
,
chiefly
with
locusts
.
It
appears
to
be
generally
admitted
by
Ornithologists
that
the
favourite
food
of
the
Rose-coloured
Starling
consists
in
early
summer
of
locusts
,
and
later
of
cherries
:
in
confinement
it
eats
cockroaches
with
avidity
:
it
should
certainly
never
be
fed
as
that
unfortunate
example
was
,
which
many
years
ago
was
winged
at
Chelmondiston
,
in
Suffolk
,
and
is
said
by
Messrs.
Sheppard
and
Whitear
to
have
been
kept
alive
for
three
months
on
raw
meat
.
All
true
Starlings
will
eat
meat
,
but
it
is
not
good
for
them
,
though
less
injurious
than
in
the
case
of
members
of
the
family
Turdida
.
Lord
lyilford
observes
that
"
The
Rose-coloured
Pastor
thrives
well
in
captivity
,
but
the
constant
chatter
of
even
a
single
bird
is
almost
overpowering
in
a
room
.
"
Doubtless
this
is
the
case
,
but
no
rank-feeding
voracious
birds
are
suitable
pets
for
a
dwelling-room
,
for
other
reasons
:
in
a
bird-room
they
are
more
bearable
;
but
,
to
see
Starlings
to
perfection
,
they
should
be
kept
in
a
good-sized
aviary
.
I
have
frequently
seen
Pastor
roscns
offered
for
sale
,
but
was
not
sufficiently
struck
with
the
bird
to
give
the
price
required
for
it
.
Herr
Wiener
,
however
,
observes
(
Cassell
's
Cage-birds
,
p.
424
)
:
—
"
I
doubted
the
accounts
I
had
read
of
Starlings
waging
a
war
of
extermination
against
locusts
and
grasshoppers
;
till
seeing
one
day
a
Rose-coloured
Pastor
offered
for
sale
,
I
remembered
that
I
had
a
hot-pit
over-run
with
crickets
,
and
resolved
to
try
an
experiment
.
The
Pastor
was
placed
in
an
aviary
,
and
I
proceeded
to
catch
crickets
by
placing
balls
of
crumpled
brown
paper
into
the
warmest
corners
of
the
pit
.
Hundreds
of
livel}^
crickets
could
be
shaken
out
of
the
papers
in
the
morning
,
and
I
could
thus
produce
at
pleasure
something
like
a
swarm
of
grasshoppers
.
A
well-bred
terrier
will
face
any
number
of
his
natural
enemies
—
rats
;
but
his
zeal
is
nothing
com-↵pared
to
the
Pastor
's
powers
of
methodical
destruction
of
grasshoppers
and
crickets
.
The
crickets
covered
the
ground
on
which
the
bird
stood
:
they
ran
iip
his
legs
and
over
his
body
,
and
coolly
would
he
peck
away
,
devouring
one
after
the
other
,
until
none
were
left
.
Whei^e
he
put
all
the
insects
seemed
incomprehensible
;
but
the
immense
services
which
such
insectivorous
birds
,
with
endless
appetites
,
can
render
to
the
agriculturist
are
palpable
.
"
In
confinement
this
species
should
be
fed
like
the
Common
Starling
upon
the
usual
soft
food
,
with
the
addition
of
such
fruit
as
happens
to
be
in
season
,
and
any
insects
which
can
be
obtained
.
Doubtless
,
like
S/iinius
vult^aris
,
it
would
be
all
the
better
if
allowed
to
have
access
to
a
saucer
of
seed
:
the
fact
that
the
bird
is
a
perfect
scourge
in
the
Indian
fields
of
white
millet
being
a
sufficient
answer
to
those
aviculturists
who
assert
that
seed
is
an
nnnatural
food
for
insect-↵ivorous
birds
.
FAMILY
CORVID.F:
.
THE
Crows
are
generally
characterized
by
their
large
size
:
in
the
form
of
the
bill
they
differ
considerably
;
but
it
seems
to
be
invariably
hard
,
with
the
nostrils
at
the
base
,
and
usually
concealed
by
feathers
;
the
feet
are
always
strong
and
scutellated
,
with
powerful
curved
claws
;
the
middle
toe
shorter
than
the
tarsus
,
the
outer
and
middle
toes
united
at
the
base
and
often
to
the
first
joint
;
the
tail
has
twelve
feathers
.
The
family
is
represented
in
the
British
Isles
by
five
genera
:
—
Pyrrliocoyax
;
in
which
the
bill
is
slender
,
arched
,
pointed
and
compressed
;
the
wings
graduated
,
with
the
fourth
primary
longest
:
Altci/raga
;
in
which
the
bill
is
stout
,
straight
,
and
with
swollen
base
;
the
wings
graduated
,
but
with
the
fifth
primary
counting
from
the
front
of
wiug
longest
:
Gaii-ulus
;
with
stout
compressed
bill
,
straight
at
the
base
;
the
crown
with
erectile
crest
;
wings
moderately
long
and
rounded
,
the
fourth
to
sixth
primaries
nearly
of
equal
length
:
Pica
;
with
stout
compressed
bill
,
straight
at
the
base
,
arched
towards
the
tip
,
near
to
which
the
edge
of
the
upper
mandible
is
slightly
emarginate
;
the
wings
short
and
rounded
,
with
the
fourth
or
fifth
primar}^
longest
;
the
tail
very
long
:
Coi'viis
;
with
bill
nearly
as
in
Pica
;
the
wings
long
and
graduated
,
with
the
fourth
primary
longest
.
The
Crows
are
cosmopolitan
:
according
to
Seebohm
they
"
are
almost
omni-↵vorous
,
and
are
found
in
most
localities
,
however
bare
and
sterile
.
They
are
birds
of
powerful
,
though
rather
heavy
flight
,
and
on
the
ground
walk
with
ease
.
Their
notes
are
harsh
and
immusical
.
They
build
bulk}'
nests
of
sticks
,
moss
,
roots
,
etc.
,
in
the
branches
of
trees
,
on
cliffs
,
and
in
holes
in
tree-trunks
,
walls
,
and
rocks
.
Their
eggs
are
from
four
to
eight
in
number
,
and
vary
from
almost
white
to
green
,
and
in
one
or
two
instances
red
,
in
ground-colour
,
spotted
and
blotched
with
green
of
varying
degrees
of
intensity
.
"
As
pets
the
Corvida.
generally
are
favourites
,
on
account
of
their
intelligence
,
the
ease
with
which
they
can
be
tamed
,
their
amusing
tricks
,
their
general
hardiness
,
omnivorous
tendencies
,
and
lastly
the
marvellous
mimicking
powers
which
some
of
them
possess
:
the
chief
drawbacks
to
keeping
these
birds
are
their
natural
tendency
to
mischief
and
pilfering
when
allowed
comparative
liberty
and
the
labour
necessary
to
keep
them
clean
when
caged
:
they
are
best
kept
separately
in
small
flights
—
about
three
feet
high
,
two
feet
wide
,
and
seven
feet
long
.

IN
a
cape
the
general
aspect
of
this
bird
is
rather
tliat
of
a
Starling
than
a
Crow
;
Init
on
the
wing
it
has
a
decidedly
more
Corvine
character
.
Of
its
distribntion
outside
the
British
Isles
,
Howard
Saunders
says
:
—
"
In
the
Channel
Islands
,
especially
Guernsey
,
the
Chough
is
tolerably
common
,
and
it
breeds
in
some
of
the
rocky
portions
of
the
north-western
and
west
coasts
of
France
,
as
well
as
in
those
of
Portugal
.
It
is
,
however
,
in
inland
,
mountainous
situations
,
such
as
some
parts
of
the
Alps
,
the
Carpathians
,
the
Parnassus
,
the
Urals
,
the
Appenincs
,
the
Pyrenees
,
and
the
south
of
Spain
,
that
it
is
most
abundant
,
while
on
the
rocky
islands
of
the
Mediterranean
it
is
plentiful
;
it
is
also
resident
in
the
liill
-regions
of
Northern
Africa
,
Abyssinia
,
Arabia
,
Asia
Minor
,
the
Caucasus
,
and
Persia
,
and
throughout
the
mountain
ranges
of
Asia
,
as
far
as
north-eastern
China
.
"
Although
scarcely
a
migratory
species
,
it
is
considered
capricious
,
inasmuch
as
localities
long
inhabited
by
it
are
,
for
no
apparent
reason
,
suddenly
abandoned
;
in
Great
Britain
this
has
been
especially
noticed
.
In
1868
and
1869
,
I
observed
great
numbers
of
Choughs
about
the
cliffs
at
Clifton
,
and
again
between
Linton
and
Ilfracombe
,
but
some
twenty
years
ago
a
friend
who
was
staying
at
the
latter
place
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
obtaining
an
egg
of
the
species
.
Seebohm
observes
:
—
"
It
still
breeds
in
Cornwall
,
the
north
of
Devon
,
on
Lnndy
Island
,
*
and
at
man}'
places
on
the
Welsh
coast
,
in
Glamorgan
,
Pembroke
,
Angelsey
,
Flint
,
Denbigh
,
and
possibl}'
on
the
rocks
of
the
Calf
of
Man
.
On
the
east
coast
of
England
,
More
states
(
"
Ibis
,
"
1865
,
p.
132
)
that
a
few
pairs
were
known
to
nest
near
Fast
Castle
,
in
Berwickshire
,
and
Hancock
corroborates
the
statement
,
whilst
in
the
Channel
Islands
the
bird
,
although
local
,
still
breeds
.
In
Scotland
it
appears
to
have
been
much
commoner
recentl}'
than
at
the
present
time
,
and
to
have
now
quite
deserted
its
inland
haunts
,
being
only
found
on
the
ocean
cliffs
.
"
"
In
Ireland
the
numbers
have
also
decreased
.
"
In
colouring
the
Chough
is
shining
black
,
glossed
-with
blue
and
purple
;
the
wings
slightly
greenish
;
the
bill
and
feet
are
orange-vermilion
;
iris
brown
.
The
female
is
a
little
smaller
than
the
male
.
Young
birds
have
the
bill
and
feet
dull
orange
.
The
haunts
of
the
Chough
are
chiefl}'
sea-side
cliffs
and
rugged
mountain
sides
,
and
Dixon
mentions
that
he
observed
a
colon}'
in
Algeria
"
in
a
low
ridge
of
rocks
,
on
the
side
of
one
of
the
barren
stony
valleys
near
the
snow-capped
summit
"
of
Djebel
Mahmel
.
It
is
gregarious
in
its
habits
and
appears
to
pair
for
life
.
Its
flight
is
somewhat
characteristic
;
consisting
largely'
,
as
Howard
Saunders
says
,
of
"
a
series
of
curves
in
the
air
,
alternatel}-
rising
with
a
scream
,
and
then
suddenl}'
dropping
with
almost
closed
wings
"
;
its
red
bill
is
distinguish-↵able
at
a
considerable
distance
:
on
the
earth
it
both
walks
and
runs
.
Seebohm
renders
the
cry
of
the
Chough
as
Khef-o
,
klia'-o
;
but
Howard
Saunders
says
—
"
The
usual
cry
is
a
clear
metallic
'Kling
,
'
but
in
autumn
I
have
heard
flocks
uttering
'chough-chough
'
very
plainly
.
"
The
food
consists
of
insects
and
their
larvae
,
worms
,
probabl}'
mollusca
,
berries
and
grain
.
The
nest
is
usually
situated
in
some
wholl}'
inaccessible
hole
or
cixvice
,
often
at
some
distance
from
the
opening
,
in
the
face
of
an
overhanging
cliff
or
near
the
roof
of
a
cave
;
but
sometimes
in
old
castles
,
church-towers
,
or
disused
lime-↵kilns
;
it
is
constructed
of
dry
plant-stems
,
frecjuently
of
heather
,
and
lined
with
dead
grass
,
rootlets
,
wool
,
and
hair
,
or
with
some
of
these
materials
only
.
The
eggs
,
three
to
six
in
number
,
vary
from
dull
creamy
to
greenish-white
in
ground-↵colour
,
and
are
more
or
less
boldly
spotted
and
streaked
with
various
shades
of
brown
and
grey
,
some
specimens
having
the
markings
pretty
evenly
distributed
over
the
entire
surface
,
whilst
others
have
them
chiefly
massed
towards
the
larger
extremity
.
Nidification
generally'
commences
late
in
April
or
early
in
May
.
Many
local
names
have
been
given
to
this
bird
,
amongst
which
those
of
Cornish
Crow
and
Red-legged
Crow
are
somewhat
freely
used
;
one
of
the
names
Hermit
Crow
is
hardly
applicable
to
a
bird
which
lives
and
breeds
in
colonies
.
Seebohm
says
that
the
"
Chough
,
like
the
Rook
,
leaves
its
roosting-place
early
in
the
morning
,
and
repairs
to
the
neighbouring
pastures
in
search
of
food
,
some-↵times
even
being
seen
to
follow
the
plough
to
pick
up
worms
and
grubs
.
It
is
always
a
restless
and
a
wary
bird
,
never
remaining
long
in
one
spot
,
but
shifting
its
ground
in
short
uncertain
flights
.
"
It
may
be
questioned
Avhether
this
species
ever
attains
a
great
age
in
confine-↵ment
,
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
form
any
definite
opinion
,
because
of
the
apparent
carelessness
with
which
exhibitors
note
the
ages
of
birds
:
thus
a
Chough
for
many
years
took
a
first
prize
at
the
Crj'Stal
Palace
which
seemed
to
have
been
five
years
old
in
1S87
,
ten
years
old
in
1890
,
and
twelve
years
old
in
1891
;
since
which
time
it
became
contented
with
a
twelve-month
year
:
possibly
there
may
have
l)een
three
cock
birds
;
bnt
,
with
a
species
the
nestlings
of
which
mnst
be
difficult
to
secure
,
this
would
seem
less
probable
than
that
an
error
had
occurred
in
slating
the
age
,
due
perhaps
to
the
fact
of
no
record
having
been
kept
to
which
reference
could
be
made
.
That
the
Chough
can
be
induced
to
breed
in
a
state
of
partial
domestication
has
been
proved
by
Lady
Nevill
(
"
Zoologist
,
"
1882
,
p.
431
)
;
she
says
:
—
"
For
years
when
I
lived
at
Dangstein
I
kept
Choughs
f
P.
'^raculns
)
able
to
flv
where
they
liked
.
They
once
attempted
to
make
a
nest
in
a
stoke-hole
,
l)ut
were
disturbed
,
and
never
did
so
again
.
Oi\
my
removal
to
East
Sussex
I
brought
the
Choughs
(
two
pairs
)
with
me
,
and
the
next
year
one
pair
made
their
nest
in
a
tower
attached
to
the
house
,
and
laid
three
eggs
;
but
they
did
not
sit
well
,
and
the
eggs
were
not
hatched
:
two
of
them
were
pulled
out
of
the
nest
.
The
one
pair
drove
the
others
away
,
for
when
they
first
came
they
all
roosted
in
the
tower
.
"
It
seems
extremely
probable
that
breeding
experiments
with
one
pair
would
be
successful
.
There
is
,
however
,
one
very
strong
objection
to
Choughs
in
captivity
:
I
understand
that
my
friend
Mr.
Reginald
Phillipps
,
a
very
well-known
aviculturist
,
at
one
time
attempted
to
keep
these
birds
;
but
the
noise
which
they
made
was
so
appalling
that
the
neighbours
were
driven
to
the
verge
of
madness
,
and
he
wisely
parted
with
his
pets
before
any
tragic
climax
had
been
arrived
at
.

Although
apparently
a

in

of

it

wanders
in

,
occurring
in
various
other
portions

,
as
well
as
in

and
North

.
To
Great
Britain
the
Nutcracker
is
an
occasional
straggler
,
about
twenty-five
tolerably
well
authenticated
instances
of
its
appearance
in
our
islands
having
occurred
,
usually
in
autumn
or
at
the
commencement
of
winter
;
but
in
May
,
1899
one
frequented
a
fir-plantation
near
Thetford
,
Norfolk
,
one
was
shot
at
Ilkley
,
Yorkshire
,
in
January
1901
,
and
another
at
Benendeu
,
Kent
,
in
January'
1905
.
In
Scotland
it
has
occurred
,
but
not
in

Stevenson
(
Birds
of
Norfolk
,
p.
284
)
commenting
upon
the
difference
in
the
form
of
the
bill
in
various
examples
of
this
bird
shot
in
Great
Britain
,
suggests
that
it
is
a
sexual
character
;
the
distinctions
which
he
records
are
exactly
such
as
one
would
expect
to
find
—
the
male
with
a
stout
straight
bill
,
the
female
with
a
longer
and
decidedl}'
narrower
one
.
*
I
believe
that
all
Passerine
birds
differ
sexually
in
this
respect
,
and
that
the
male
birds
recognize
the
females
by
their
faces
alone
;
indeed
there
is
little
difficulty
in
detecting
the
dissimilarity
in
the
features
of
any
of
these
birds
,
when
the
sexes
are
compared
side
by
side
.
Using
this
character
alone
,
which
was
first
pointed
out
to
nie
by
Mr.
Joseph
Abrahams
,
I
have
never
yet
failed
to
correctly
pair
up
the
sexes
of
birds
for
breeding
purposes
,
where
no
assistance
could
be
gained
by
a
study
of
the
plumage
.
I
am
,
therefore
,
certain
that
its
importance
has
not
been
appreciated
by
Ornithologists
.
In
his
account
of
the
Nutcracker
,
vSeebohm
takes
the
late
Rev
.
F.
O.
Morris
somewhat
too
seriously
:
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
the
latter
gentleman
compiled
his
work
on
British
Birds
,
he
was
unable
to
discover
any
facts
relating
to
the
nidification
of
our
species
,
and
,
therefore
,
fell
back
wpon
the
nesting
habits
of
the
genus
as
given
in
Jerdon
's
Birds
of
India
,
where
we
read
—
"
They
breed
in
holes
in
trees
,
which
they
excavate
,
or
enlarge
,
with
their
powerful
Woodpecker-like
bills
,
"
etc.
,
and
doubtless
when
the
revised
edition
was
published
in
1870
,
Mr.
Morris
had
not
discovered
that
a
genuine
description
of
the
nest
had
been
pub-↵lished
in
1862
,
which
differed
in
all
points
from
that
accepted
by
Dr.
Jerdou
.
In
June
,
1862
,
Professor
Newton
exhibited
the
nest
and
fnlly
fledged
j-oung
of
this
species
at
a
meeting
of
the
Zoological
Society
of
London
:
he
had
received
them
from
Pastor
Theobald
,
and
J.
C.
H.
Fisher
,
of
Copenhagen
,
who
had
taken
them
in
Bornholm
.
At
that
time
they
had
failed
to
secure
eggs
of
the
species
.
At
a
meeting
in
January
,
1867
,
Professor
Newton
exhibited
a
nest
with
four
eggs
,
observing
:
—
"
In
1863
,
my
friends
were
again
disappointed
of
getting
the
eggs
of
this
bird
,
which
proved
to
be
a
still
earlier
breeder
than
the}'
had
given
it
credit
for
;
and
on
the
9th
of
April
three
young
ones
were
found
.
In
1864
the}'
deter-↵mined
to
'
be
wise
in
time
.
'
They
kept
two
young
men
on
the
watch
all
the
winter
,
and
as
spring
approached
carefnl
search
was
made
.
At
length
,
on
the
23rd
of
March
,
after
eight
days
'
labour
,
the
nest
was
found
,
in
the
same
part
of
the
forest
as
the
nest
of
the
year
before
,
being
indeed
only
some
fifty
feet
from
the
.same
spot
.
It
was
,
therefore
,
in
all
probability
,
built
by
the
same
pair
of
birds
.
It
was
in
a
fir
tree
,
about
fifty
feet
high
,
and
built
quite
in
the
same
manner
as
that
of
the
former
year
.
The
seeker
took
the
precaution
first
to
climb
up
a
near-extending
tree
,
and
then
,
seeing
the
Nutcracker
on
the
nest
,
ascended
the
nest-tree
itself
and
took
the
four
eggs
,
which
,
when
sent
to
Herr
Theobald
,
were
blown
by
him
and
found
to
be
quite
fresh
.
"
In
1865
,
owing
to
the
severity
of
the
preceding
winter
,
these
gentlemen
did
not
receive
a
nest
quite
so
early
,
their
seekers
only
discovering
one
containing
three
eggs
on
the
lotli
of
April
;
but
they
secured
a
second
,
with
four
eggs
,
on
the
30th
of
the
same
mouth
:
finally
,
in
March
1866
,
a
nest
with
one
egg
was
found
,
but
the
birds
deserted
it
without
laying
again
.
Seebohm
obser\es
that
"
the
breeding-season
of
the
Nutcracker
in
the
Arctic
regions
is
evidently
Jnne
and
July
—
at
least
ten
weeks
later
than
in
Central
Europe
.
"
The
situation
of
the
nest
is
said
to
be
always
on
a
not
very
tall
pine-tree
,
from
eighteen
to
twenty-five
feet
from
the
ground
,
on
a
branch
against
the
stem
.
It
is
about
a
foot
in
diameter
,
about
five
inches
in
depth
,
with
the
cavity
four
inches
in
diameter
,
and
from
one
and
a
half
to
two
inches
in
depth
.
The
foundation
is
composed
of
lichen-covered
twigs
of
larch
and
spruce
,
finished
off
with
fresh
birch-twigs
,
and
lined
with
dry
grass
and
the
inner
bark
of
trees
,
with
a
little
loose
eartli
;
the
final
lining
is
grass
,
generally
dry
,
but
sometimes
fresh
.
"
The
number
of
eggs
is
from
three
to
five
;
they
are
bluish
or
creamy- white
,
with
the
surface-spots
olive
or
leather-brown
,
and
with
grey
shell-spots
:
in
the
distri-↵bution
of
the
markings
and
their
size
they
vary
much
as
in
other
Corvuicc
.
Although
,
in
the
winter
,
vSeebohm
says
that
"
Their
tameuess
was
quite
absurd
.
They
allowed
us
to
go
within
three
feet
of
them
;
and
sometimes
they
even
permitted
us
to
touch
them
with
a
stick
,
"
this
confidence
disappears
during
the
breeding-season
when
they
become
very
shy
and
wary
.
The
food
of
the
Nutcracker
consists
of
insects
of
all
kinds
and
their
larvse
,
the
larger
dung-laeetles
having
been
found
in
its
stomach
,
as
well
as
many
other
species
of
different
Orders
,
seeds
of
conifers
,
nuts
,
acorns
,
berries
,
etc
.
It
is
probable
tliat
it
also
devours
the
eggs
and
newly
hatched
young
of
other
birds
.
Seebohm
mentions
two
notes
:
—
the
first
,
which
he
considers
to
be
the
call-↵note
,
is
a
sort
of
plaintive
kya\
,
kray
;
the
other
,
which
he
thinks
is
the
alarm-note
is
a
loud
grating
kr-kr-kr
.
The
following
notes
respecting
the
Nutcracker
in
captivity
were
kindly
forwarded
to
me
by
the
late
Rev
.
H.
A.
Macpherson
.
"
It
was
early
in
the
year
1893
that
a
pair
of
Nutcrackers
entered
my
possession
.
I
understood
that
the
London
dealer
from
whom
I
purchased
them
had
received
them
from
Hungary
.
They
were
in
fine
condition
,
and
I
placed
them
in
an
out-door
aviary
.
The
plumage
of
these
birds
was
identical
,
but
the
male
was
a
finer
and
larger
bird
than
his
companion
.
Their
lively
movements
recalled
my
observations
of
this
species
in
the
Bernese
Oberland
.
All
their
actions
were
sprightly
and
animated
.
The
agility
with
which
the
Nutcracker
hops
from
one
branch
of
pine
to
another
resembles
the
action
of
the
Common
Jay
.
These
tame
birds
lived
upon
Spanish
nuts
.
We
usually
broke
the
nuts
open
for
them
,
but
tliej'
could
perform
the
task
for
themselves
.
The
Nutcracker
first
inserts
a
nut
into
a
suitable
crevice
,
and
then
breaks
it
with
repeated
blows
of
the
bill
.
The
nut
is
then
shelled
,
and
the
kernel
is
swallowed
,
the
outside
being
allowed
to
fall
to
the
ground
.
The
male
bird
seemed
to
tyrannize
over
his
mate
,
at
least
he
gave
her
many
sly
pecks
which
she
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
.
They
differed
occasionally
about
the
possession
of
a
nut
,
for
tlie
cock
often
tried
to
rob
his
mate
,
and
she
made
ever}'
endeavour
to
retain
her
tit-bit
,
squeaking
in
a
low
key
.
It
was
on
the
19th
of
February
that
I
first
saw
the
male
Nutcracker
feeding
his
mate
:
she
fluttered
her
wings
all
the
time
,
and
cried
as
a
young
bird
might
have
done
.
Thereafter
the
relations
of
these
birds
became
most
intimate
.
I
tried
mv
best
io
induce
them
to
nest
in
the
aviar^'
,
but
they
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
breed
in
confinement
.
Unfortunately
,
my
health
broke
down
completely
in
the
spring
of
1893
;
I
was
obliged
to
leave
my
birds
to
the
care
of
a
friend
.
When
I
returned
to
duty
in
the
following
September
I
found
my
birds
newly
dead
,
to
ni}'
great
regret
.
The
female
had
died
from
moulting
troubles
.
It
was
thought
that
her
faithful
mate
had
died
of
grief
,
as
he
pined
awaj^
from
the
day
of
her
decease
.
The
late
Lord
Lilford
informed
me
in
1893
,
that
he
had
kept
a
number
of
Nutcrackers
in
confinement
.
He
said
that
his
birds
were
specially
fond
of
hazel-↵nuts
and
walnuts
.
They
were
supplied
also
with
'ever}'
other
variety
of
nut
and
berries
that
could
be
procured—
hips
,
haws
,
peas
,
beans
,
acorns
,
blackberries
,
beech-mast
,
cones
of
spruce
,
boiled
rice
,
stale
bread-crumbs
,
hard-boiled
egg
,
now
and
then
a
little
boiled
liver
,
beetles
,
earthworms
and
crushed
hemp-seed
.
The
latter
was
mixed
with
dried
ants
'
eggs
.
'
I
must
say
that
ni}-
birds
declined
to
eat
anything
except
nuts
;
but
I
was
away
on
sick-leave
during
the
months
in
which
their
diet
would
naturally
have
varied
most
.
The
late
Mr.
John
Hancock
kept
a
specimen
of
the
Nutcracker
in
confinement
for
six
years
.
'
Its
voice
was
very
peculiar
.
It
had
an
extremel}'
harsh
,
loud
cry
,
resembling
the
noise
produced
by
a
ripping
saw
while
in
full
action
.
This
cry
was
so
loud
that
it
could
be
heard
all
over
the
house
.
It
had
also
a
sweet
,
low
,
delicate
,
warbling
song
.
This
was
only
uttered
when
everything
was
quiet
.
'
I
never
heard
my
male
sing
.
He
crozved
,
with
a
loud
guttural
caw
,
which
was
uttered
while
the
bird
perched
in
a
drawn
,
upright
position
,
the
mandibles
being
visibly
extended
.
He
had
a
low
squeaking
note
of
pleasure
,
and
could
address
his
mate
in
curious
terms
of
endearment
.

WIDELY
distributed
and
resident
throughout
Europe
excepting
in
the
south-east
:
in
Asia
and
Algeria
several
more
or
less
differentiated
forms
occur
which
interbreed
and
produce
intergrades
,
thus
rendering
their
separation
by
Ornithologists
a
very
arbitrary
and
difficult
task
.
Although
still
fairly
common
in
the
woodlands
of
England
,
in
spite
of
the
incessant
persecution
to
which
it
is
subjected
by
game-keepers
,
farmers
,
and
gardeners
,
the
Jay
is
rapidly
becoming
rarer
in
Scotland
,
yet
is
still
b}^
no
means
scarce
in
the
southern
counties
,
whilst
in
Ireland
,
where
it
was
(
in
all
probability
)
at
one
time
,
pretty
generally
distributed
,
it
is
now
not
only
confined
to
the
south
,
but
is
only
of
local
occurrence
.
About
the
month
of
October
,
a
considerable
immigration
of
Jays
takes
place
,
largely
adding
to
the
number
bred
in
Great
Britain
.
This
beautiful
bird
has
the
crown
covered
by
a
well-defined
crest
,
the
smaller
feathers
of
which
are
tipped
and
the
larger
ones
streaked
with
black
;
nape
and
back
vinous-brown
;
rump
and
upper
tail-coverts
white
;
wing-coverts
with
the
outer
webs
regularly
barred
with
black
,
white
,
and
silvery-blue
,
the
inner
webs
black
;
primaries
dull
black
,
externally
edged
with
white
,
secondaries
shining
black
,
the
innermost
feather
mostly
chestnut
,
the
remainder
with
large
white
patches
on
the
basal
half
of
the
outer
w^eb
;
tail
black
,
the
outer
pair
of
feathers
brownish
;
ear-coverts
pale
vinous-brown
;
a
broad
black
moustachial
streak
from
the
base
of
the
bill
;
chin
and
throat
buffish-white
;
breast
and
abdomen
vinaceous
,
deeper
on
the
flanks
;
vent
and
under
tail-coverts
white
.
Bill
blackish
horn-brown
,
feet
brown
,

.
The
female
resembles
the
male
in
colouring
,
but
is
smaller
,
has
a
shorter
crest
and
a
broader
and
shorter
bill
.
The
young
chiefl}'
differ
in
having
the
iris
pale
blue
.
It
is
difficult
to
explain
how
it
has
come
about
that
the
colouring
of
the
adult
and
3'oung
eye
in
the
Jay
has
been
transposed
in
British
Bird
books
.
Like
many
other
young
animals
this
bird
when
a
baby
has
innocent
blue
eyes
,
which
,
however
,
change
soon
after
its
first
moult
to
a
vinous-brownish
colour
,
a
little
brighter
than
the
colouring
of
its
back
,
and
this
colouring
becomes
permanent
.
I
only
became
aware
of
the
fact
after
I
had
completed
the
rearing
of
a
fine
3'oung
bird
which
was
given
to
me
;
but
my
statement
has
since
been
confirmed
by
Mr.
Meade- Waldo
and
others
.
Not
many
years
ago
this
was
a
tolerably
common
bird
in
the
Kentish
woods
;
nevertheless
I
but
rarely
found
its
nest
,
not
more
than
three
or
four
times
at
most
.
I
can
onl}'
suppose
that
,
in
that
county
,
the
Jay
may
have
been
so
perse-↵cuted
,
that
it
has
to
some
extent
departed
from
its
customary
plan
of
building
low
down
;
and
,
like
the
Magpie
,
has
made
its
home
in
the
inaccessible
branches
of
some
lofty
tree
:
that
such
a
proceeding
would
not
be
unprecedented
is
clear
from
the
fact
that
Sterland
described
a
nest
which
he
found
at
the
top
of
a
beech
tree
,
fifty
or
sixty
feet
from
the
ground
.
The
Jay
is
essentially
a
bird
of
the
woods
and
is
far
more
frequently
heard
than
seen
on
account
of
its
extreme
wariness
;
now
and
again
you
ma}'
come
suddenly
upon
it
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
its
showy
plumage
as
it
flaps
irregularly
across
some
opening
into
the
sheltering
foliage
,
screaming
harshly
as
it
flies
—
cliaik
,
cliaik
,
cliaik
:
indeed
I
once
disturbed
a
compau}^
of
five
in
a
small
clearing
.
The
alarm
note
often
commences
with
a
frightened
sort
of
whine
;
it
is
vcr}'
harsh
arrt^li
,
arrgh
.
Seebohm
gives
a
singularly
accurate
account
of
tlic
habits
of
this
bird
in
a
state
of
freedom
:
—
"
The
Jay
becomes
noisiest
in
the
evening
;
and
its
discordant
notes
may
then
be
heard
together
with
those
of
the
Pheasant
and
the
Magpie
.
Numbers
of
the
birds
call
together
,
or
answer
each
other
from
different
parts
of
the
cover
,
and
,
with
the
note
of
the
Wood-Owl
and
the
purr
of
the
Nightjar
,
make
a
concert
sounding
singularl}^
uncanny
amidst
the
gloom
of
the
forest
.
The
flight
of
the
Jay
is
a
somewhat
laboured
one
,
performed
very
irregularly
and
with
rapid
beatings
of
the
wings
.
The
Jay
's
peculiar
flight
is
seen
to
the
greatest
per-↵fection
when
the
bird
is
flying
in
the
open
;
for
in
the
thick
cover
they
appear
to
scurry
off
amongst
the
branches
,
anxious
to
conceal
themselves
as
soon
as
possible
.
In
spring
the
Jay
may
sometimes
be
observed
to
fly
at
a
considerable
elevation
above
its
native
woods
,
and
,
suddenly
closing
its
wings
to
shoot
downwards
like
an
arrow
into
the
cover
below
.
Although
capable
of
long-sustained
flight
,
in
this
country
it
rarely
flies
far
,
preferring
to
go
from
tree
to
tree
or
to
pursue
its
waj'-
through
the
tangled
undergrowtli
.
When
perched
in
a
tree
the
Jay
sits
well
upright
,
its
tail
sometimes
wafted
to
and
fro
,
its
head
constantly
turned
from
side
to
side
,
and
its
crest
erected
or
depressed
,
its
restless
actions
showing
its
wariness
and
timidity
at
being
so
far
from
cover
.
When
thus
perched
the
Jay
can
sometimes
be
approached
very
closely
;
and
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
,
that
singularly
beautiful
and
conspicuous
as
the
bird
's
plumage
is
,
it
is
rarely
seen
until
its
harsh
note
proclaims
its
departure
ti)
a
safer
retreat
.
"
If
not
aware
of
the
viciuit}'
of
man
,
however
,
the
Jay
is
by
no
means
so
shy
,
his
curiosit}'
soon
gets
the
better
of
his
nervousness
and
he
conies
into
the
open
to
investigate
the
cause
of
every
sound
;
j'et
he
is
ever
on
the
alert
and
the
least
sudden
movement
sends
him
back
instantly
to
cover
.
The
nest
of
the
Jay
is
believed
to
be
rarely
built
at
a
great
height
from
the
ground
,
of
those
which
I
found
the
highest
elevation
was
about
sixteen
feet
,
in
the
branches
of
a
sapling
too
slender
to
support
the
weight
of
a
man
,
so
that
I
and
my
companion
were
compelled
to
draw
it
gradually
down
until
I
was
able
to
lift
out
the
nest
from
its
cradle
of
twigs
.
My
first
nest
was
in
a
plantation
of
ash-↵trees
and
so
near
the
ground
that
I
was
able
to
lift
it
down
without
climbing
,
it
contained
a
full
clutch
of
six
eggs
,
and
I
had
no
sooner
taken
it
than
both
parents
,
who
were
close
b}'
,
made
the
whole
neighbourhood
ring
with
their
harsh
screams
of
rage
;
I
caught
a
glimpse
of
one
of
them
,
but
only
for
a
moment
,
it
had
not
sufficient
courage
to
come
close
.
The
nest
is
frequently
placed
in
hawthorn
,
sloe
,
hazel
,
fir
,
yew
,
or
holly
,
and
is
very
compact
and
strongl}-
built
,
though
externally
it
has
a
ragged
appearance
,
being
constructed
of
interlaced
sticks
and
twigs
,
which
become
denser
and
are
moulded
into
a
neat
cup-shape
in
the
centre
:
the
lining
consists
of
rootlets
or
grasses
and
horsehair
.
The
eggs
number
from
five
to
seven
and
,
excepting
that
their
average
size
is
larger
,
much
resemble
one
of
the
less
t3'pical
varieties
of
the
Blackbird
's
egg
:
in
ground
colour
they
are
pale
green
,
so
densely
mottled
with
lighter
or
darker
clay-colour
that
their
general
tone
is
either
pale
olivaceous
stone-↵colour
,
or
pale
cla3
--
colour
;
at
the
larger
extremity
which
is
usually
slightly
deeper
in
tint
,
there
is
very
frequently
an
irregular
black
line
,
like
a
crack
:
sometimes
the
darker
area
forms
a
scarcely
perceptible
zone
,
the
extremity
itself
being
quite
pale
.
The
time
of
nidification
is
from
the
latter
end
of
April
to
about
the
middle
of
May
,
most
nests
being
found
in
the
second
month
;
but
it
has
been
known
for
the
Jay
to
be
still
later
,
perhaps
owing
to
a
first
nest
having
been
plundered
.
The
food
of
this
bird
consists
in
summer
of
worms
,
spiders
,
insects
,
eggs
,
young
birds
,
and
fruit
;
but
later
in
the
year
,
chiefly
of
berries
,
acorns
,
beech-↵mast
and
nuts
.
In
captivity
its
food
is
still
more
varied
,
Mr.
J.
H.
Gurney
,
(
Zoologist
1892
,
p.
429
)
,
gives
the
following
as
the
diet
supplied
to
two
tame
Jays
—
"
The
first
one
would
eat
worms
,
grapes
and
acorns
,
with
equal
avidity
;
but
its
beak
could
not
pierce
the
acorn
's
husk
until
it
had
been
partly
pared
off
,
then
holding
it
with
its
foot
the
bird
would
rapidly
pull
it
to
pieces
with
its
strong
beak
.
In
the
same
way
,
if
a
dead
sparrow
is
given
to
a
Jay
,
it
will
stand
on
one
part
of
it
while
with
its
beak
it
tugs
at
another
,
after
the
manner
of
a
hawk
.
My
Jay
would
eat
the
orange
berries
of
the
Solanuni
,
if
hungry
,
but
did
not
care
in
the
least
for
yew
and
privet
berries
.
Jay
No
.
2
devoured
peas
by
making
a
hole
in
the
side
of
the
pod
,
and
after
it
had
got
them
all
out
it
would
amuse
itself
by
pulling
the
pod
to
pieces
,
no
doubt
to
look
for
more
.
Sparrow
's
eggs
dropped
into
the
cage
were
adroitly
caught
before
they
reached
the
bottom
,
and
a
mouse
or
a
.shrew
was
very
acceptable
.
Being
put
into
the
same
cage
as
a
Carrier
Pigeon
and
a
Turtle
Dove
,
in
spite
of
a
disabled
wing
,
and
though
the
cage
was
nine
feet
long
,
the
Jay
soon
despatched
the
latter
by
pecking
its
back
.
"
As
cage-birds
Jays
are
great
favourites
,
not
only
on
account
of
their
wonderful
powers
of
mimicry
,
but
because
,
as
Lord
Lilford
says
,
"
In
captivity
the
Jay
is
a
most
amusing
pet
and
becomes
very
tame
.
There
is
little
trouble
in
keeping
it
in
good
health
and
condition
,
as
in
the
matter
of
food
scarcely
anything
comes
amiss
.
We
have
found
,
however
,
that
more
than
one
of
these
birds
in
our
possession
preferred
the
eggs
of
small
birds
to
any
other
food
.
"
I
became
po.ssessed
of
a
young
English
Jay
in
the
summer
of
1898
,
and
reared
it
satisfactorily
;
it
proved
to
be
the
largest
and
most
beautiful
cock
bird
that
I
ever
saw
,
either
alive
or
dead
.
Although
gifted
in
imitating
cats
,
dogs
,
distant
poultry
,
the
sound
of
trumpet
and
jews'-harp
,
the
splashing
of
water
and
mixing
of
bird-seed
,
I
could
only
succeed
in
teaching
it
to
say
two
words
—
"
Hullo
Jimmy
!
"
which
,
however
,
have
become
its
favourite
utterances
:
it
is
extremely
playful
and
expects
me
to
stop
and
have
a
game
with
it
every
morning
at
feeding-↵time
.
For
staple
food
I
give
a
mixture
of
two
parts
crumb
of
stale
household
bread
,
one
part
powdered
biscuit
,
one

BEAUTIFUL
beyond
all
our
other
Crows
,
the
Magpie
unhappil_y
has
so
many
enemies
among
game-preservers
,
that
its
numbers
in
some
parts
of
Great
Britain
have
sadly
diminished
.
Its
distribution
is
most
clearly
defined
by
Howard
Saunders
:
—
"
From
the
North
Cape
in
Scandinavia
southward
,
it
is
found
,
more
or
less
plentifully
throughout
Europe
,
except
in
the
islands
of
Corsica
and
Sardinia
;
but
it
does
not
occur
in
Palestine
,
although
found
in
Asia
Minor
.
Eastward
—
subject
to
a
variation
in
the
amount
of
white
in
the
plumage
,
which
has
led
to
the
creation
of
several
bad
species
—
the
Magpie
is
found
across
Asia
to
India
,
China
and
Japan
,
and
also
in
the
northern
portion
of
America
from
the
Pacific
to
Michigan
.
"
In
England
,
Wales
and
Scotland
,
this
species
is
still
fairly
common
and
widely
distributed
.
In
Ireland
it
is
not
only
abundant
,
but
its
numbers
are
in-↵creasing
.
Perhaps
the
comparative
scarcity
of
this
species
at
the
present
time
in
some
of
the
southern
counties
may
be
due
almost
as
much
to
the
wholesale
de-↵struction
of
timber
,
which
has
of
late
years
been
carried
on
by
land-owners
,
as
to
the
undoubted
enmity
which
game-keepers
show
to
it
.
In
a
wood
near
Newington
,
on
the
Chatham
and
Dover
line
,
I
have
often
seen
several
pairs
both
of
this
bird
and
the
Jay
simultaneously
flying
iip
from
their
feeding- ground
in
a
small-clearing
;
but
now
that
wood
is
converted
into
pasturage
and
hop-gardens
:
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
many
a
once
grand
hunting-ground
for
the
Naturalist
,
for
miles
and
miles
around
that
neighbourhood
.
Alas
for
Kent
,
once
the
garden
of
England
!
it
is
rapidly
becoming
a
mere
dreary
expanse
of
wire-fenced
fields
and
hop-poles
.
The
Magpie
is
chiefly
glossy
black
,
showing
purple
and
green
reflections
;
but
the
rump
is
whitish-grey
;
the
scapulars
white
,
the
inner
webs
of
the
primaries
with
a
white
patch
;
the
tail
with
greenish-bronze
and
purple
reflections
,
and
with
a
purplish-black
subterminal
band
;
abdomen
snow- white
:
bill
and
feet
black
,
iris
dark
brown
.
Female
slightly
smaller
and
duller
than
the
male
,
and
with
a
slightly
shorter
and
heavier
bill
.
Young
birds
somewhat
duller
than
adults
.
To
see
the
full
beauty
of
this
grand
bird
on
the
wing
,
one
must
be
behind
it
,
as
with
Imoyant
l)ul
somewhat
jerky
flight
,
it
floats
down
some
liroad
pheasant
drive
,
exhibiting
its
pied
wings
and
superb
tail
to
perfection
;
it
,
however
,
rarely
remains
long
in
view
,
its
aerial
excursions
being
generally
of
short
duration
.
AltlKiugh
fond
of
woodland
and
forest
,
the
Magpie
is
not
strictly
confined
to
tliem
.
for
it
often
wanders
through
well
timbered
valleys
,
or
even
over
moorland
;
whilst
in
the
pastures
it
may
not
unfrequently
be
observed
upon
the
backs
of
feeding
cattle
,
searching
for
ticks
and
maggots
.
Referring
to
this
habit
Lord
Lilford
observes
:
—
"
I
am
assured
by
an
experienced
tenant-farmer
in
our
neighbour-↵hood
that
he
considers
this
remedy
worse
than
the
disease
,
as
the
Alagpies
in
the
search
for
maggots
acquire
a
taste
for
beef
,
and
cause
hideous
sores
which
are
difficult
to
treat
.
"
The
Magpie
is
at
times
both
restless
and
noisy
,
but
chiefly
when
aware
of
the
approach
of
man
whom
it
has
learnt
from
sad
experience
to
look
upon
with
suspicion
.
Naturallj-
less
shy
than
the
Jay
,
it
would
doubtless
soon
be
confiding
if
mankind
would
but
treat
it
more
gentl}'
:
it
is
indeed
an
ascertained
fact
,
that
wherever
it
is
not
persecuted
,
this
bird
commouly
builds
its
nest
close
to
the
habitations
of
man
,
and
in
most
conspicuous
places
.
Even
where
it
is
not
looked
upon
with
favour
,
this
is
sometimes
the
case
,
for
in
1884
,
I
noticed
the
unmistak-↵able
nest
of
this
species
at
the
top
of
a
lofty
elm-tree
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
house
in
which
I
was
staying
,
at
Upchurch
,
near
Newington
,
Kent
.
The
tree
formed
one
of
a
row
along
the
end
of
a
field
,
and
quite
close
to
the
main-↵line
of
the
Chatham
and
Dover
Railway
.
I
also
saw
the
nest
close
to
the
little
village
of
Bobbing
in
a
small
spinney
.
Although
half
afraid
to
trust
one
,
and
ever
on
the
alert
,
the
Magpie
often
keeps
but
a
short
distance
ahead
as
one
passes
through
its
haunts
,
either
in
the
trees
above
,
or
on
the
ground
;
at
one
moment
it
will
be
peering
and
chattering
from
a
branch
,
the
tail
rising
and
falling
,
or
opening
and
shutting
,
after
the
manner
of
the
South
American
Jays
;
now
it
will
drop
buoyautl}'
down
to
the
scrub
,
whence
it
will
appear
upon
the
path
,
and
then
for
a
short
space
flit
down
the
same
to
rise
again
to
a
branch
and
repeat
the
whole
performance
.
The
Magpie
is
single-brooded
and
breeds
early
,
usually'
constructing
its
nest
towards
the
end
of
March
,
though
sometimes
as
late
as
IMa}-
,
and
most
frequently
placing
it
in
the
outer
branches
,
though
less
often
near
the
highest
point
of
the
main
stem
:
sometimes
,
however
,
tall
,
or
even
low
hedges
as
well
as
thorn-bushes
are
selected
as
a
building
site
.

B.
Pilley
,
(
"
Zoologist
"
1891
,
p.
352
)
,
observes
that
,
when
he
was
a
boy
,
he
and
his
companions
believed
that
there
were
two
species
of
Magpies
,
one
building
in
a
tree
,
the
other
in
a
hedge
,
and
he
says
:
—
"
I
can
distinctly
remember
the
sorry
plight
I
sometimes
presented
after
climbing
to
tlie
top
of
a
high
hawthorn
hedge
to
discover
the
contents
of
a
nest
.
"

.
A.
Davies
,
(
"
Zoologist
"
1892
,
p.
29
)
,
remarks
that
:
—
"
In
Norwaj-
they
nearly
always
prefer
bushes
,
if
procurable
.
Whilst
travelling
in
1890
,
in
the
Saetersdal
,
I
observed
that—
as
noticed
by
Mr.
Saunders
in
his
'
Manual
of
British
Birds
,
'
—
very
often
the
nests
were
built
under
the
eaves
of
the
houses
.
In
some
cases
the
peasants
had
placed
large
props
under
the
eaves
for
the
nest
to
rest
upon
:
in
others
the
nest
appeared
to
be
built
half
inside
the
house
,
between
gaps
in
the
timbers
.
The
Magpie
is
regarded
as
a
bird
of
good
omen
,
and
it
is
constantly
encouraged
as
much
as
possible
to
nest
near
the
house
.
In
one
place
I
saw
,
in
a
low
fir-tree
close
to
a
house
,
no
less
than
nine
Magpies
'
nests
.
I
never
heard
before
of
Magpies
nesting
in
colonies
.
"
Lord
Lilford
says
that
in
Spain
he
frequently
met
with
"
nests
which
could
be
examined
without
any
climbing
,
and
,
still
more
,
whose
contents
were
attainable
from
horseback
:
"
he
also
,
as
recorded
b}'
Howard
Saunders
,
"
found
several
nests
in
the
papyrus
reeds
of
the
Anapo
,
near
Syracuse
.
"
The
nest
itself
is
ver^^
bulk}'
and
when
built
openly
is
alwaj-s
roofed
over
with
a
basket-like
covering
of
thorny
sticks
,
between
which
and
the
nest
proper
,
which
is
made
of
the
same
materials
cemented
together
with
mud
,
there
is
only
a
narrow
entrance
:
the
cup
of
the
nest
is
very
deep
and
neatly
lined
with
rootlets
.
The
eggs
number
from
six
to
eight
,
rarely
nine
,
and
are
pale
emerald
green
(
or
exceptiouall}'
fleshy-white
)
;
a
clutch
of
five
in
my
collection
obtained
in
the
village
of
Bobbing
in
Kent
,
in
May
,
1888
,
are
uniforml}^
flecked
all
over
with
short
irregular
olive
markings
interspersed
with
dots
of
the
same
colour
;
but
others
have
the
spotting
massed
at
the
larger
,
or
more
rarely
,
at
the
smaller
end
,
and
in
some
cases
there
are
blotches
and
streaks
of
brown
among
the
other
markings
,
and
I
have
seen
eggs
coloured
and
marked
like
those
of
the
Pied
Wagtail
.
*
The
male
bird
takes
his
share
in
the
duties
of
incubation
.
The
food
of
this
bird
consists
of
snails
,
worms
,
insects
and
their
larvae
,
eggs
,
3-oung
birds
,
mice
,
carrion
;
and
later
in
the
year
,
fruit
,
beech-mast
,
and
acorns
,
as
well
as
grain
when
procurable
.
Early
in
August
,
1879
,
Mr.
Frohawk
saw
considerable
flocks
feeding
on
the
fallows
in
North
Devon
.
The
natural
note
of
the
IMagpie
is
a
harsh
chattering
;
but
,
like
some
of
the
other
Crows
he
is
a
good
mimic
and
,
as
Swaysland
observes
,
"
is
easily
taught
to
talk
.
"
Lord
Lilford
remarks
:
—
"
In
confinement
or
,
more
properly
speaking
,
in
semi-captivity
,
the
Magpie
is
a
very
amusing
bird
,
but
his
ceaseless
chatter
is
,
to
our
ears
,
most
unmusical
and
annoying
,
and
his
thieving-
and
hiding-instincts
have
long
been
historically
famous
or
infamous
.
Mr.
J.
Lewis
Bouhote
,
of
Cambridge
,
who
has
kept
all
the
British
Corvida
at
various
times
,
with
the
exception
of
the
Raven
,
writes
as
follows
:
—
^"
The
Magpie
is
a
nice
sprightly
bird
,
and
when
hand-reared
is
beautifulh'
tame
;
he
seems
to
be
the
least
pugnaceous
of
this
rather
vicious
family
.
His
merry
rattling
note
is
a
nice
change
from
the
ordinary
croak
so
frequently
uttered
.
"
Like
all
the
famil}'
,
this
bird
if
caged
should
not
be
closely
confined
;
the
cage
for
a
Magpie
or
Jay
should
be
at
least
five
feet
in
length
,
over
three
feet
in
height
and
two
feet
in
width
;
otherwise
the
bird
does
not
get
sufficient
exercise
,
misses
his
daily
bath
and
often
becomes
ragged
and
unsightly

BREEDS
and
is

throughout
the
greater
part
of
Europe

but
does
not
occur
northwards
beyond
central
Scandinavia
;
southwards
in
the
Mediterranean
basin
it
becomes
very
local
:
it
has
straggled
along
the
African
coast
as
far
as
the
Canaries
.
In
Asia
it
occurs
northwards
in
Western
Siberia
as
far
as

60°
;
but
in
the
valley
of
the
Yenesei
,
Seebohm
only
observed
it
as
far
north
as
lat

56°
;
southwards
it
is
common
in
South

Turkestan
,
westwards
through
the
Caucasus
to
Asia

and
Palestine
,
aud
southwards
to
Cashmere
aud
Afghanistan
where
it
breeds
,
visiting
the
plains
of
N.W
.
India
in
the
winter
.
In
Great
Britain
it
breeds
and
is
resident
in
most
suitable
localities
;
though
on
the
rock-bound
portions
of
our
coasts
it
is
frequently
replaced
by
the
Chough
;
the
two
species
being
very
rarely
found
occupying
the
same
district
.
In
the
Outer
Hebrides
it
has
not
been
met
with
,
and
to
the
Shetlands
it
is
only
a
straggler
.
The
upper
parts
of
the
male
Jackdaw
are
glossy
black
with
purple
aud
green
reflections
;
the
ear-coverts
,
nape
and
sides
of
neck
ashy-grey
inclining
to
white
;
under
parts
dull
black
;
bill
and
feet
black
,
iris
greyish-white
.
The
female
is
slightlj'
smaller
than
the
male
and
has
a
slightly
smaller
and
duller
grey
patch
on
the
nape
;
her
bill
is
also
a
trifle
shorter

The
young
are
dull
black
,
the
grey
patch
very
feebly
indicated
.
There
are
few
places
where
the
Jackdaw
can
not
find
a
home
:
coming
from
the
Continent
to
England
,
this
bird
may
be
.seen
in
numbers
flj'ing
in
and
out
of
holes
in
the
cliffs
of
Dover
,
its
incessant
cries
clunk
,
chack
,
being
a
welcome
sound
;
so
also
in
country
or
town
,
in
ruined
castle
or
modern
palace
the
Jackdaw
is
everywhere
to
be
seen
.
I
must
confess
that
I
like
the
Jackdaw
:
he
is
a
bird
with
considerable
sense
of
humour
,
and
(
in
spite
of
much
persecution
)
he
seems
to
bear
no
malice
.
The
late
Lord
Lilford
,
however
,
could
find
nothing
good
to
say
of
him
:
the
following
being
some
of
his
remarks
respecting
the
Jackdaw
in
his
"
Birds
of
Northamptonshire
"
:
—
"
This
amusing
but
most
pernicious
bird
is
extremely
common
in
our
county
,
and
probably
onl}'
too
well-known
to
most
of
our
readers
.
In
the
hollow
trees
about
the
park
and
pleasure-grounds
of
Lilford
they
used
to
swarm
at
the
breeding-season
,
till
we
found
it
absolutely
necessary
to
wage
war
upon
them
in
the
interests
of
our
garden
,
poultry
,
and
game
,
to
say
nothing
of
those
of
the
Barn
Owl
,
a
species
for
which
we
have
always
entertained
a
sincere
respect
and
affection
.
The
Daws
not
only
carried
off
numbers
of
young
chickens
,
pheasants
,
and
partridges
,
and
committed
havoc
among
our
green-peas
and
other
vegetables
,
but
in
several
instances
,
to
oirr
knowledge
,
took
possession
of
the
Owls
'
nests
,
destroyed
their
eggs
,
and
piled
up
their
own
nests
in
the
cavities
selected
by
the
harmless
and
most
useful
bird
of
night
;
occasionally
,
however
,
the
tables
are
turned
,
as
we
have
previously
mentioned
when
treating
of
the
Barn
Owl
.
For
these
misdemeanours
we
have
for
some
years
past
made
a
practice
of
shooting
the
old
Jackdaws
and
destroying
their
nests
and
eggs
wherever
we
found
them
,
with
the
result
of
decided
benefit
to
ourselves
and
our
neighbours
.
The
Jackdaw
disputes
the
palm
for
noisy
and
obtrusive
impudence
with
the
House-Sparrow
,
and
does
not
,
to
our
knowledge
,
compensate
us
in
any
way
for
his
misdoings
.
That
the
Daw
fulfils
his
duties
in
the
great
scheme
of
nature
I
do
not
deny
,
but
must
confess
that
I
am
unable
to
discover
what
they
may
be
.
"
Seebohm
,
however
,
although
he
admits
that
it
levies
blackmail
on
the
Gulls
,
says
of
the
Jackdaw
:
—
"
It
is
quite
as
harmless
a
bird
as
the
Rook
,
and
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
it
is
very
useful
.
You
have
but
to
watch
its
actions
in
the
fields
to
be
convinced
of
this
.
"
The
Jackdaw
's
flight
is
like
himself
,
strong
,
but
somewhat
purposeless
;
he
sets
off
to
fly
to
sonic
point
,
chang-es
his
mind
,
swings
graccfnllv
ronnd
and
alights
on
the
exact
spot
from
wliich
he
started
;
indeed
he
is
very
fond
of
aerial
evolntions
;
his
wings
are
rapidly
flapped
when
on
the
wing
,
and
when
he
alights
on
the
ground
he
generally
comes
down
with
either
a
see-sawing
or
spiral
motion
.
On
the
gronnd
he
is
almost
as
fussy
as
a
Starling
in
his
search
for
worms
or
leather-jackets
of
which
I
have
seen
him
carry
many
to
his
nest
from
my
garden
:
undoubtedl}-
he
does
fulfil
his
duties
in
the
scheme
of
nature
.
The
cries
of
this
bird
have
been
varioush'
described
as
cae.
caiv
,
(jiiick
,
jack
,
c
vc
,
but
the
only
notes
which
I
have
licard
uttered
by
wild
Jackdaws
have
been
cliack
and
cli,u-k
,
from
which
sounds
,
without
question
,
its
name
has
been
derived
:
its
note
is
utterly
unlike
that
of
the
Rook
or
au}'
of
the
other
British
Crows
.
The
Jackdaw
as
a
rule
is
gregarious
in
its
habits
;
although
in
the
suburbs
,
a
pair
will
sometimes
take
possession
(jf
a
chimne3%
in
which
they
will
build
alone
;
consorting
,
however
,
when
feeding
,
with
the
Rooks
which
inhabit
some
avenue
of
elms
in
the
neighbourhood
:
but
,
whenever
possible
,
this
species
breeds
in
colonies
,
the
nest
being
almost
invariably
placed
in
some
crevice
or
hole
in
rock
,
building
,
tree
,
*
or
even
a
rabbit-burrow
;
ivy-clad
ruins
and
belfries
of
old
churches
being
favourite

Nidification
commences
in
April
t)r
May
,
frequently
not
until
the
latter
month
,
and
the
nest
varies
considerably
in
bulk
according
to
the
site
in
which
it
is
con-↵structed
;
it
is
always
carelessly
formed
and
generally
of
the
veriest
rubbish
;
wool
and
moss
are
often
used
,
but
th(jse
which
I
have
Rmnd
in
belfries
consisted
mere!}'
of
sticks
and
a
little
dirty
straw
,
with
a
fe\v
feathers
;
whilst
one
in
my
collection
taken
from
the
winding
staircase
leading
up
to
the
belfry
of
old
]\Iiltou
Church
,
near
Sittingbourne
,
on
25th
May
,
1887
,
consists
of
a
great
mass
of
hair
(
either
the
winter-coat
of
horses
,
or
refuse
from
a
barber
's
)
with
a
little
loose
earth
,
a
dead
leaf
or
two
,
and
a
little
dirty
straw
:
the
depression
for
the
eggs
is
very
shallow
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
and
vary
a
good
deal
,
but
the
commonest
type
is
pale
blue
,
more
or
less
boldly
spotted
with
sepia
,
and
with
lavender-grey
shell-spots
;
sometimes
the
spots
are
absent
,
and
I
have
seen
a
few
eggs
in
which
the
markings
were
small
,
numerous
,
and
pale
,
almost
resembling
eggs
of
the
Alagpie
.
The
Jackdaw
pairs
for
life
:
it
rears
only
one
brood
in
a
season
.
Its
food
consists
in
summer
chiefly
of
worms
,
all
kinds
of
ininrious
grubs
,
especially
those
of
the
crane-fly
,
the
cockchafer
,
the
wireworm
,
also
insects
,
mollusca
,
and
(
it
must
alas
be
admitted
)
eggs
and
j^oiing
of
other
birds
,
grain
,
peas
and
earh'
fruits
:
later
ill
tlie
3ear
,
fruit
,
bcech-niast
,
acorns
,
and
all
kinds
of
refuse
,
including
carriou
,
are
eaten
.
Not
only
is
the
Jackdaw
keen-sighted
,
as
I
shall
presently
show
,
but
its
scent
Mould
seem
to
be
very
acute
:
My
friend
Mr.
J.
C.
Pool
,
of
Birmingham
,
wrote
(
nth
January
,
1896
)
,
respecting
a
nest
of
this
species
which
he
found
:
—
"
The
nest
was
in
a
hole
in
a
decaying
tree
about
fifteen
feet
from
the
ground
.
I
climbed
the
tree
,
and
on
looking
into
the
hole
I
saw
a
number
of
3'oung
ones
which
seemed
to
be
a
week
or
ten
days
old
.
In
order
to
ascertain
the
number
of
young
,
I
took
three
out
of
the
nest
and
held
them
in
1113'
hand
,
while
I
looked
again
into
the
nest
and
found
onl}'
one
remained
.
I
then
replaced
the
three
in
the
nest
and
left
them
.
Next
morning
I
passed
by
the
bottom
of
the
tree
and
was
surprised
to
see
a
young
Jackdaw
lying
on
the
gr(nind
dead
,
and
as
I
was
certain
I
had
placed
the
three
young
ones
properl}-
into
the
nest
,
and
also
that
they
could
not
possibly
have
fallen
out
,
the
nest
being
fully
two
feet
below
the
entrance
,
I
again
mounted
the
tree
.
Half-way
up
to
the
nest
I
found
a
second
young
one
lying
on
a
branch
,
dead
,
and
a
third
l3'ing
on
a
ledge
inside
the
hole
of
the
tree
,
but
about
a
foot
from
the
nest
.
One
young
one
still
remained
in
the
nest
alive
and
strong
.
I
did
not
touch
this
one
,
but
I
subsequently
observed
the
old
birds
1^3ang
to
the
nest
with
food
.
I
think
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
old
birds
threw
out
the
three
that
I
had
had
in
my
hands
,
probably
because
the3^
had
contracted
the
scent
.
I
was
visiting
m3'
friend
on
whose
ground
the
tree
is
,
last
week
,
and
I
found
the
Jackdaws
have
again
nested
in
the
same
hole
,
but
they
had
not
hatched
then
.
If
I
can
get
over
again
before
the
3'oung
ones
leave
the
nest
I
will
try
the
experiment
again
and
test
them
.
"
Later
in
the
3'ear
Mr
.
Pool
wrote
:
—
"
I
did
not
have
a
chance
of
confirming
the
matter
of
Jackdaws
,
for
when
I
went
to
do
so
,
I
found
someone
had
been
before
me
and
had
taken
the
young
ones
.
"
In
captivity
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
its
imitative
faculty
is
inferior
to
that
of
the
Raven
,
Magpie
,
or
Ja3'
,
as
also
that
it
is
the
most
incorrigible
thief
of
all
the
Crows
,
the
Jackdaw
is
a
very
general
favourite
.
It
is
always
full
of
mischief
and
takes
quite
as
much
delight
in
practical
jokes
as
its
owner
gets
from
watching
their
performance
:
there
is
something
irresistibly
funny
in
watching
a
Jackdaw
and
a
cat
together
;
the
latter
anxious
to
indulge
her
selfish
and
indolent
nature
,
Ijy
curling
up
in
the
sun
to
sleep
away
the
best
hours
of
the
day
;
whilst
the
Jackdaw
,
equall3'
bent
on
keeping
her
awake
,
slips
up
behind
and
tweaks
her
tail
.
Before
the
cat
can
spring
to
her
feet
,
swearing
and
spitting
,
the
Jackdaw
has
hopped
sideways
under
a
chair
;
and
,
as
she
swings
round
to
avenge
herself
,
he
snaps
at
lier
tail
again
;
the
mystification
and
rage
of
the
cat
are
exceeding!}'
Indicrous
,
as
also
is
the
adroit
way
in
which
the
Jackdaw
invariably
evades
her
.
The
keenness
of
vision
of
the
Jackdaw
is
perhaps
never
so
ninch
appreciated
as
when
one
experiments
with
a
tame
example
.
For
man}'
years
ni}'
old
friend
Dr.
lohn
Grayling
,
of
Sittingbourne
,
had
a
tame
Jackdaw
in
his
garden
.
Tliis
bird
was
particularly
fond
of
hazel-nuts
,
and
would
catch
every
one
that
was
thrown
at
him
;
but
if
you
took
two
or
three
nuts
with
about
the
same
number
of
pebbles
in
your
hand
,
and
flung
them
at
the
bird
,
one
after
the
other
as
rapidly
as
possible
,
he
caught
every
nut
,
and
evaded
every
stone
,
without
fail
:
his
manner
of
avoiding
a
missile
made
you
look
small
,
for
he
never
moved
farther
than
was
neccssarj-
,
sometimes
merely
lowering
his
head
,
or
taking
a
step
to
right
or
left
.
*
When
one
considers
how
marvellously
powerful
a
bird
's
vision
must
be
to
enable
it
,
in
a
second
,
to
distinguish
between
a
nut
and
a
similarly-coloured
pebble
,
leading
it
instantaneously
to
decide
whether
to
catch
or
avoid
it
;
it
seems
preposterous
to
imagine
that
it
can
ever
hesitate
as
to
the
nature
of
a
leaf-like
insect
,
however
well
it
may
seem
to
be
disguised
to
our
less
discriminating
sight
:
indeed
I
am
fully
convinced
that
if
a
dozen
leaf-like
insects
(
recently
killed
to
prevent
their
showing
movement
)
and
an
eqiial
number
of
similar
crumpled
leaves
were
flung
on
the
floor
of
an
aviary
containing
insectivorous
birds
of
any
kind
,
it
would
not
be
long
before
all
the
insects
had
been
selected
and
devoured
.
As
the
Jackdaw
is
almost
omnivorous
,
there
is
never
any
difficult}^
in
feeding
it
in
captivity
:
but
the
bird
is
less
entertaining
in
a
flight-cage
than
when
(
with
one
wing
clipped
)
it
is
allowed
the
run
of
the
place
.

from

of

in
the
north
to
the
Mediterranean
in

and
throughout
northern

to
the

;
whilst
in
America
it
extends
across
the

from
the

to
Greenland
and
southwards
to
Guatemala
and
possibly
Honduras
,
though
to
the
east
of
the
Mississippi
it
is
somewhat
rare
and
local
.
In
England
,
probably
owing
to
the
systematic
persecution
to
which
it
has
l)een
subjected
,
the
Raven
is
becoming
very
rare
,
though
a
few
pairs
still
breed
regularly
in
the
rocky
headlands
of
our
southern
and
south-western
coasts
.
Howard
Saunders
observes
that
nests
built
in
trees
,
although
far
rarer
than
formerly
,
are
less
uncommon
than
might
be
supposed
at
short
distances
inland
.
Not
long
ago
several
pairs
bred
in
Essex
.
To
this
I
can
add
that
in
the
winter
of
1885-6
a
pair
of
Ravens
used
daily
to
pass
over
ni}'
garden
at
Penge
(
where
I
then
lived
)
and
on
mentioning
the
fact
to
a
friend
in
the
train
he
told
me
he
knew
of
a
pair
which
had
a
nest
in
the
spring
of
1885
not
far
from
Beckenham
,
but
he
intended
to
keep
its
situation
to
himself
,
lest
I
should
be
tempted
to
try
and
secure
the
eggs
.
In
Scotland
,
and
particularly
the
Outer
Hebrides
and
other
Western
Isles
northwards
to
the
Shetlauds
,
it
is
still
common
;
whilst
it
is
found
in
the
wilder
regions
of
Ireland
.
The
Raven
is
glossy
black
,
with
iridescent
purple
and
Prussian
blue
tints
on
the
upper
parts
and
throat
;
bill
and
feet
black
,
iris
brown
.
The
female
is
smaller
,
and
less
distinctly
shot
with
purple
and
blue
;
her
bill
is
slightly
shorter
.
The
young
resemble
the
female
,
but
lack
the
metallic
gloss
of
adult
birds
.
The
bird
of
Odin
is
widely
regarded
with
superstitious
awe
;
its
sable
colouring
,
gruff
croaking
notes
,
and
its
delight
in
carrion
,
however
foul
and
putrid
,
have
doubtless
conspired
to
stamp
it
as
a
bird
of
evil
omen
;
3'et
,
to
watch
a
pair
of
Ravens
at
pla}'
,
gives
one
no
feeling
of
horror
or
disgust
;
for
their
foolish
antics
and
absurd
lateral
jumps
are
irresistibly
laughable
.
Lord
Lilford
(
"
Birds
of
Northamptoushire
,
"
\'ol
.
I
,
pp
.
212-213
)
observes
:
—
"
We
have
had
many
opportunities
of
closely
observing
the
habits
of
this
eminently
sagacious
bird
in
various
parts
of
the
world
,
and
,
in
spite
of
his
tendencies
to
murder
,
assault
,
and
robbery
,
we
must
confess
to
a
great
liking
for
him
.
The
Raven
is
in
this
county
a
very
earl}-
breeder
,
generally
selecting
a
secure
ledge
in
a
cliff
,
more
rarely
a
tall
tree
,
and
returning
to
the
same
locality
for
nesting
3-ear
after
j'ear
.
The
young
birds
often
leave
the
nest
during
the
first
fortnieht
of
March
,
sometimes
before
that
date
.
We
have
more
than
once
heard
of
a
full
complement
of
eggs
early
in
Februarj'
,
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
found
unfledged
j-oung
in
more
than
one
Raven
's
nest
as
late
as
the
middle
of
Ma}'
.
The
old
birds
are
always
wary
,
one
always
keeping
a
close
look-out
whilst
the
other
is
on
the
nest
,
and
immediately
uttering
a
warning
note
on
the
approach
of
danger
.
We
have
heard
of
Ravens
vigorously
attacking
persons
attempting
to
harm
their
nests
,
but
have
never
witnessed
anything
of
the
sort
,
our
experience
being
to
the
eftect
that
,
during
the
siege
,
the
parent
birds
usually
soar
high
in
air
over
the
nest
,
uttering
,
besides
their
usual
croak
of
alarm
or
anger
,
a
curious
sound
,
like
the
noise
made
by
drawing
a
tightly
fitting
cork
from
a
bottle
,
occasionally
turning
complete
somersaults
in
the
air
,
and
making
ferocious
stoops
in
the
direction
of
the
invader
,
but
always
keeping
well
out
of
gunshot-range
.
For
some
time
after
the
young
Ravens
leave
the
nest
they
roam
in
company
with
their
parents
,
but
soon
separate
and
start
off
singly
or
in
couples
on
marauding
expeditions
on
their
own
account
.
"
Although
not
strictly
speaking
a
gregarious
species
,
this
bird
when
attracted
by
food
often
assembles
in
considerable
numbers
;
wheu
approaching
a
carcass
it
does
not
fly
directly
to
it
,
but
alights
at
a
short
distance
and
approaches
it
warily
with
heavy
ungainly
hops
.
Upon
the
wing
it
flaps
heavily
,
but
its
flight
,
nevertheless
,
is
powerful
and
tolerabl}'
rapid
.
The
nest
of
the
Raven
is
always
bulky
,
though
more
so
when
built
on
ledges
of
rocks
than
when
placed
in
trees
;
it
consists
of
sticks
,
twigs
,
heather-↵stems
,
and
sometimes
a
tangle
of
sheep
's
wool
.
The
lining
is
of
roots
,
grass
,
wool
,
fur
,
or
other
soft
materials
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
frequently
five
;
in
ground-colour
they
usually
vary
from
greenish-blue
to
olive-greenish
,
more
or
less
densely
marked
with
deep
olive-brown
,
the
shell
markings
appearing
frequently
like
smears
or
faint
patches
of
the
same
colour
(
as
if
partly
washed
out
)
;
the
pattern
and
character
of
the
markings
vary
much
as
usual
,
sometimes
the
streaks
and
blotches
are
few
and
large
,
sometimes
they
are
mingled
with
numerous
smaller
markings
,
sometimes
again
the
small
spots
are
so
close
together
as
to
give
a
different
tone
to
the
egg
;
the
depth
of
the
markings
also
varies
mucli
,
at
times
almost
approaching
black
.
Seebohm
speaks
of
a
variety
of
rare
occurrence
which
is
"
reddish-white
in
ground-colour
,
spotted
with
rich
reddish-↵brown
and
splashed
with
grej^

The
commonest
note
of
the
Raven
has
been
variously
described
as
cnick
,
01/ck
,
or
pntck
,
pruck
;
to
me
it
sounds
like
ivliurk

ivliiirk

its
note
of
rage
has
been
described
as
"
a
menacing
bark
"
and
"
an
angry
hoarse
growl

Mr.
E.
C.
Phillips
in
a
paper
on
the
Birds
of
Breconshire
(
"
Zoologist
,
"
1882
,
pp
.
45-46
)
says
:
—
"
This
bird
lives
to
a
great
age
.
When
a
boy
,
in
Wiltshire
,
I
used
to
pay
a
visit
—
generall}'
on
a
Sunda_v
—
to
some
friends
that
lived
in
a
manor
house
where
there
was
a
tame
Raven
,
he
was
then
about
twenty
years
old
,
and
full
of
all
sorts
of
mischief
and
iniquity
,
but
being
a
great
favourite
and
a
good
talker
he
had
pretty
much
his
own
way
.
I
remember
him
well
,
for
on
one
occasion
he
took
a
small
slice
out
of
mj-
leg
,
iit
??ws
fuif
,
and
retired
to
the
top
of
the
spout
to
digest
it
,
amidst
my
yells
and
the
threats
of
the
whole
party
.
Happening
to
be
near
the
place
twenty-five
years
afterwards
,
I
ventured
to
ask
for
my
old
friend
,
and
to
my
surprise
out
he
came
with
the
same
side-↵long
hop
,
the
same
malicious
twinkle
in
his
e3'e
,
and
looking
more
sleek
and
diabolical
than
ever
.
I
only
heard
of
his
death
last
autumn
.
He
took
a
similar
liberty
with
a
large
dog
that
he
did
with
my
leg
,
and
got
a
nip
in
return
that
killed
him
.
He
must
have
been
fifty
years
old
when
he
died
,
and
was
one
of
the
finest
birds
I
have
ever
seen
.
"
Lord
Lilford
's
account
of
his
Ravens
is
very
entertaining
,
especially
that
of
his
bird
Sankey
:
—
"
He
would
take
any
opportunity
that
presented
itself
of
testing
the
consistency
of
the
lower
garments
or
shoe-leather
of
an
unwary
male
of
our
species
;
but
we
seldom
heard
of
his
attacking
a
woman
.
At
any
strange
dog
,
large
or
small
,
he
'
went
in
,
'
and
after
bestowing
a
hearty
dig
on
his
hinder
parts
,
used
to
retire
to
some
coign
of
vantage
and
mock
his
foe
,
with
an
often-repeated
'
bow-wow
,
'
uttered
in
a
complacent
and
sympathetic
tone
,
which
must
have
been
peculiarly
aggravating
to
the
injured
one
.
"
"
Any
superfluous
food
was
generally
hidden
away
for
future
consumption
,
and
the
hiding-places
often
quaintly
chosen
;
e.g
.
we
once
saw
the
Raven
care-↵fully
part
the
long
feathers
on
the
back
of
one
of
our
Emus
,
insert
a
small
fish
from
liis
pouch
,
rearrange
the
feathers
,
and
hop
off
with
the
air
of
having
done
a
very
clever
thing
.
"
As
regards
tlie
possibility
of
this
species
breeding
in
confinement
,
I
niaj'
quote
the
following
note
given
to
me
bv
Mr.
J.
E.
llarting
for
my
"
Handbook
of
British
Oologj'
"
:
—
"
In
March
,
1S64
,
a
pair
of
tame
Ravens
which
had
the
run
of
a
garden
belonging
to
Mr.
Winterbottom
,
of
Cheltenham
,
built
a
nest
in
a
box
in
a
shed
about
six
feet
from
the
ground
.
The
nest
was
built
of
sticks
,
old
fern-leaves
,
and
the
stalks
of
dead
wall-flowers
,
and
was
lined
with
dead
leaves
and
tufts
of
grass
.
On
March
4th
two
eggs
were
found
in
tlie
nest
,
and
the
following
day
a
third
was
laid
;
l)ut
the
hen
bird
did
not
sit
well
,
perhaps
because
too
much
disturbed
l)y
visitors
,
and
the
eggs
were
not
hatclied
.
"
Lord
Lilford
's
last
pair
of
Ravens
,
wliieli
,
liowever
,
had
considerable
liberty
,
reared
four
young
ones
,
all
of
which
were
living
in
1894
.
In
1908
Mr.
St.
Quintin
's
Ravens
hatched
out
five
strong
young
ones
.
Mr.
J.
H.
Coniyus
,
of
Lyveudeu
,
S.
Devon
,
forwarded
to
me
a
full
account
of
a
Raven
and
Buzzard
taken
by
him
in
1896
from
nests
in
trees
:
—
"
The
Raven
was
perfectly
,
I
may
say
aggressively
,
tame
within
a
week
,
but
the
Buzzard
remained
obdurate
for
full}'
three
times
as
long
,
his
timidity
and
suspicion
being
truly
exasperating
.
"
"
As
soon
as
my
bird
was
full-grown
,
I
tried
the
experiment
of
turning
him
in
with
'
Grip
'
the
Raven
(
who
is
confined
in
a
disused
stable
on
account
of
his
depredations
in
the
neighbours
'
gardens
)
.
As
I
anticipated
,
'
Grip
'
instantly
dashed
at
the
intruder
with
murderous
intent
,
but
what
followed
was
a
surprise
to
me
.
The
Buzzard
,
after
flying
two
or
three
times
round
the
stable
,
hotly
pursued
b}'
'
Grip
,
'
suddenly
alighted
on
the
floor
and
confronted
him
with
every
feather
bristling
.
The
valour
of
the
sable
bird
of
Odin
was
evidently
tempered
with
a
wholesome
caution
;
he
stopped
too
,
with
ruffled
head
held
low
down
and
open
beak
,
panting
like
a
hound
,
whereupon
the
Buzzard
to
his
astonishment
and
consternation
sprang
at
him
.
He
instantly
beat
a
headlong
retreat
,
and
the
victor
,
after
pursuing
him
for
a
short
time
from
perch
to
perch
,
rested
on
liis
laurels
.
For
a
fortnight
after
this
,
the
Buzzard
was
master
of
the
situation
,
and
the
Raven
got
nothing
in
the
shape
of
meat
to
eat
unless
I
was
there
to
give
it
to
him
.
The
Buzzard
would
stoop
at
him
and
snatch
his
food
out
of
his
very
beak
,
as
he
unearthed
it
from
his
various
hiding-↵places
.
'
Grip
'
now
changed
his
tactics
,
and
took
to
sneaking
up
behind
and
furtively
tweaking
the
Buzzard
's
wings
or
tail
,
and
strange
to
say
,
a
persistent
course
of
these
harrassing
attacks
has
now
utterly
destroyed
the
Buzzard
's
spirit
,
evidently
too
superficial
to
stand
at
all
a
severe
test
,
and
reduced
him
from
a
really
noble-looking
bird
to
a
woe-begone
wretch
,
denuded
of
both
tail-feathers
and
primaries
.
Hitherto
I
have
kept
the
birds
together
in
the
hope
that
the
Buzzard
might
recover
his
lost
courage
,
but
I
have
now
arranged
to
separate
them
,
as
I
am
afraid
of
the
Buzzard
being
permanently
injured
.
"
The
remainder
of
Mr.
Comyns
'
notes
are
more
in
accordance
with
general
experience
,
and
there-↵fore
,
of
less
interest
.
Mr.
Frohawk
saw
seven
examples
of
this
species
at
tlie
mouth
of
the
Avon
(
S.
Devon
)
at
the
end
of
September
,
1895
;
they
all
kept
together
and
may
perhaps
have
been
the
old
and
young
of
the
same
family
.

The
Carrion-Crow
.
Corviis
iOfoiic
,
Linn
.
IN
Siberia
,
according
to
Seebohm
,
this
species
occupies
the
forest
country
Ijdng
between
Yenesay
and
the
Pacific
coast
,
extending
northwards
in
summer
almost
to
the
limits
of
forest
growth
and
south-eastwards
to
Japan
.
Westwards
he
is
of
opinion
that
,
following
the
mountain-ranges
of
southern
Siberia
into
Turkestan
,
it
crossed
the
Caspian
,
passed
through
an
equally
large
colony
of
Hooded
Crows
by
way
of
the
Caucasus
,
the
northern
shores
of
the
Black
Sea
and
the
valley
of
the
Danube
and
keeping
to
the
north
of
the
Alps
spread
over
Germany
,
the
Netherlands
,
the
British
Isles
,
France
and
Spain
.
He
was
able
also
to
prove
that
this
species
interbreeds
with
the
Hooded
Crow
in
the
valleys
of
the
Elbe
and
Yenesay
(
as
it
is
known
to
do
in
Scotland
)
producing
many
intergrades
between
the
two
species
,
examples
of
which
he
presented
to
the
Trustees
of
the
British
Museum
;
these
have
been
carefully
mounted
,
and
form
one
of
the
most
instructive
and
attractive
cases
in
the
entrance-hall
of
the
Natural
Histor}'
branch
of
that
Museum
at
South
Kensington
.
In
Great
Britain
this
species
is
justly
disliked
and
persecuted
,
both
by
shepherds
and
game-keepers
;
yet
it
is
still
by
no
means
rare
in
the
well-timbered
portions
of
England
and
Wales
,
becoming
,
however
,
decidedly
commoner
in
the
northern
counties
,
whilst
in
Scotland
it
is
abundant
;
in
the
islands
off
the
Scotch
coast
it
again
becomes
scarce
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
really
occurs
in
the
Orkneys
or
Shetlands
.
In
Ireland
it
is
a
very
scarce
bird
.
The
male
Carrion-Crow
is
glossy
black
;
purplish
above
,
and
with
green
tints
on
the
head
and
neck
;
the
wings
similarly
tinted
;
bill
and
feet
black
;
iris
brown
.
The
female
is
perhaps
slightly
less
glossy
than
the
male
,
but
does
not
otherwise
differ
in
plumage
;
her
bill
ajipears
to
be
longer
and
more
slender
than
that
of
the
male
,
which
is
unusual
in
the
Crows
.
Young
birds
are
without
gloss
and
the
inside
of
their
mouths
is
pale
flesh-coloured
.
As
opposed
to
the
absurd
notion
that
because
this
species
is
proved
to
h3-bridize
freely
with
the
Hooded
Crow
and
produce
fertile
offspring
,
it
can
not
be
a
distinct
species
,
Herr
Gatke
shrewdly
observes
:
—
"
The
very
circumstance
,
however
,
that
despite
pairing
having
taken
place
for
several
thousands
of
3'ears
,
the
two
colours
of
the
respective
species
have
remained
pure
and
distinct
,
forms
the
most
striking
proof
of
the
specific
independence
of
the
two
;
for
,
if
the}'
had
not
existed
originally
as
two
fixed
primary
forms
,
to
which
the
mongrel
offspring
reverted
,
though
this
may
have
occurred
only
after
several
generations
,
we
should
at
present
know
neither
the
one
species
nor
the
other
in
its
pure
simple
colouration
,
but
should
meet
only
with
unlimited
gradational
stages
of
mixtures
of
gre}'
and
black
forms
.
"
This
argument
,
however
,
is
not
unassailable
,
unless
it
be
claimed
that
the
three
Pheasants
—
P.
cuIchicKs
,
P.
/oi-qna/us
,
and
P.
vtrsicoloi-
,
which
also
interbreed
freely
and
produce
endless
intergrades
are
,
therefore
,
not
distinct
species
.
It
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
in
some
cases
acknowledged
sports
of
the
same
species
when
crossed
do
not
produce
intergrades
,
but
from
one
clutch
of
eggs
reproduce
examples
of
each
variety
,
as
has
been
proved
in
the
case
of
the
Barbaiy
Turtle-Dove
,
the
Gouldian
Finch
,
and
the
supposed
fertile
hybrid
known
as
the
Bengalee
.
In
many
respects
the
Carrion-Crow
resembles
the
Raven
,
inhabiting
similar
haunts
,
whether
among
the
rocky
uplands
,
or
in
woods
and
game-coverts
.
In
its
predatory
habits
it
is
almost
,
if
not
cpiite
as
much
dreaded
,
both
by
shepherd
and
game-keeper
.
Ever
seeking
for
food
from
dawn
till
dark
,
the
mischief
done
b}'
a
pair
of
this
species
in
a
single
season
must
be
enormous
.
Tliat
this
bird
has
some
courage
seems
probable
from
the
fact
that
it
will
sometimes
dispute
with
a
Gull
or
even
a
small
Hawk
,
but
it
appears
soon
to
weary
of
resisting
a
combiued
attack
,
otherwise
the
young
chicks
of
pheasants
and
partridges
would
indeed
fare
badl3
^
Lord
Lilford
observes
:
—
"
We
have
not
a
word
to
saj^
in
defence
of
the
Carrion-Crow
.
His
habits
appear
to
us
to
be
purely
noxious
,
and
neither
his
personal
appearance
,
voice
,
or
manners
in
captivity
offers
anything
in
extenuation
of
his
natixral
evil
propensities
.
"
The
flight
of
the
Carriou
-Crow
is
somewhat
laboured
,
though
at
times
very
rapid
,
its
wings
regularly
beating
the
air
;
when
approaching
the
earth
it
usually
wheels
round
in
circles
.
On
the
earth
it
either
walks
,
or
,
if
in
a
hurry
,
leaps
forward
with
half
opened
wings
after
the
fashion
of
its
kind
.
The
time
of
nidification
of
the
Carrion-Crow
is
from
the
latter
half
of
April
to
nearly
the
end
of
May
(
a
clutch
which
I
purchased
from
a
shepherd
,
whose
boys
had
just
taken
them
from
a
nest
near
the
top
of
an
elm-tree
at
Iwade
near
Sheppy
,
consisted
of
tliree
full-sized
eggs
and
one
small
yolkless
one
,
all
of
which
were
quite
fresh
on
May
25th
)
.
The
nest
is
bulky
and
the
same
structure
is
believed
to
be
used
and
added
to
year
after
year
;
it
is
either
placed
in
a
niche
,
or
on
a
ledge
of
rock
,
or
in
a
tall
tree
,
—
oak
,
elm
,
or
pine
;
but
in
Holland
it
is
said
to
be
built
upon
the
ground
.
J
.
B.
Pilley
,
of
Hereford
(
"
Zoologist
,
"
1891
,
p.
352
)
,
records
the
discovery
of
a
nest
containing
five
eggs
on
the
top
of
a
tall
hedge
,
in
some
meadows
near
the
city
.
The
nest
is
somewhat
flat
and
formed
of
dead
sticks
,
twigs
,
grass-tussocks
and
roots
,
with
a
lining
of
fur
,
wool
,
feathers
or
other
soft
materials
neatly
smoothed
down
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
six
,
five
being
a
frequent
clutch
,
and
are
sometimes
indistinguishable
from
those
of
the
Raven
,
but
usually
they
are
somewhat
smaller
;
the
ground-colour
is
bluish-↵green
and
the
markings
which
vary
considerably
in
density
consist
of
spots
,
longitudinal
streaks
and
blotches
of
olive
and
olive-brown
;
some
of
the
markings
are
frequently
almost
black
and
others
almost
grey
.
It
is
believed
that
this
Crow
pairs
for
life
.
Of
the
eggs
of
this
species
figured
on
our
plate
,
figs
.
233
,
234
and
235
are
from
Mr.
Farn
's
collection
,
and
236
from
that
of
Mr.
Frohawk
's
;
my
own
specimens
were
not
varied
or
characteristic
enough
to
be
worth
representing
.
The
call
is
a
hoarse
croak
,
but
some
of
the
other
cries
of
this
species
are
less
objectionable
.
The
food
of
this
bird
in
summer
consists
of
almost
any
kind
of
animal
too
weak
or
sickly
to
defend
itself
,
wounded
sheep
,
helpless
lambs
,
the
young
of
hares
and
rabbits
,
moles
,
young
poultry
,
ducks
,
pheasants
,
partridges
,
and
grouse
;
but
he
does
not
confine
himself
entirely
to
this
diet
,
he
also
feeds
on
mollusca
,
which
he
extracts
from
the
shells
(
as
mentioned
many
years
ago
by
Messrs.
Sheppard
and
Whitear
)
by
carrying
them
up
to
a
considerable
height
and
dropping
them
on
to
a
stone
;
stale
fish
cast
up
by
the
waves
,
and
carrion
of
all
kinds
are
devoured
greedil}'
,
as
well
as
insects
,
their
larvae
,
and
grain
.
In
the
winter
lie
is
more
limited
and
has
to
content
himself
with
grain
,
berries
,
and
such
weakly
half-starved
birds
or
beasts
as
he
can
manage
to
kill
.
Mr.
O.
V.
Aplin
(
"
Zoologist
,
"
1883
,
p.
409
)
published
the
following
note
on
the
food
of
this
species
:
—
"
An
old
disused
bridle-gate
.standing
near
one
corner
of
Clattercutt
Reservoir
has
this
season
served
as
a
feeding
spot
for
a
pair
of
Carrion-Crows
,
which
reared
their
young
in
a
tall
elm
on
one
side
of
the
pool
.
One
evening
in
June
,
after
the
grass
was
cut
,
I
found
strewn
around
it
the
remains
of
several
toads
and
frogs
,
and
of
one
partly
fledged
nestling
finch
,
also
a
number
of
broken
shells
of
the
eggs
of
the
Wild
Duck
and
Partridge
.
The
state
the
gate
was
in
showed
that
it
was
a
much
frequented
perch
,
and
a
tell-tale
wing-feather
would
have
named
the
robber
even
if
he
had
not
hurriedly
left
an
adjacent
tree
at
my
approach
,
and
with
loud
croaks
expressed
his
displeasure
at
my
intrusion
on
his
banqueting
hall
.
I
have
always
tried
to
defend
this
fine
bird
,
and
was
sorry
to
find
such
ample
proof
of
its
destructive
habits
.
Only
a
few
days
ago
(
October
1883
)
I
counted
thirty-two
Crows
in
a
stubble-field
close
to
this
village
,
and
considering
their
abundance
in
this
district
,
it
is
only
a
wonder
that
any
game
or
wildfowl
can
rear
their
j'oung
at
all
.
"
Although
inclined
to
a
solitary
life
during
the
breeding-season*
the
Carrion-↵Crow
is
seen
in
larger
or
smaller
crowds
during
the
autumn
and
winter
:
con-↵siderable
numbers
arrive
on
our
eastern
coasts
in
autumn

's
statement
that
this
bird
"
makes
almost
as
engaging
a
pet
as
the
Raven
"
hardly
accords
with
Lord
Lilford
's
opinion
of
the
Carrion-Crow
.
The
following
is
Mr.
Bonhote
's
experience
,
communicated
November
and
,
1896
:
—
"
The
Hooded
and
Carrion-Crows
are
to
be
strictly
avoided
;
the
latter
bird
when
hand-reared
is
very
tame
and
can
articulate
a
few
words
,
but
has
no
interesting
actions
or
habits
and
scarcely
moves
the
whole
day
.
The
former
bird
(
Grey
Crow
)
is
not
only
stupid
,
but
dangerous
,
and
is
never
satisfied
till
he
has
the
whole
aviary
to
himself
,
having
murdered
the
other
inmates
.

An
autumn
and
winter
visitant
to
England
and
Wales
,
where
a
few
pairs
have
,
from
time
to
time
,
remained
to
breed
;
whilst
in
the
Isle
of
Man
it
is
believed
to
breed
regularly
.
Throughout
Scotland
and
Ireland
it
is
pretty
generally
distributed
,
resident
and
common
,
interbreeding
occasionally
with
the
Carrion-Crow
in
the
former
countr}^
and
in
Wales
.
The
typical
Hooded
Crow
has
the
head
,
throat
,
and
front
of
breast
,
wings
,
tail
,
and
thighs
black
,
with
purple
and
green
gloss
;
remainder
of
plumage
ashy-↵grey
,
with
the
exception
of
the
centre
of
the
upper
tail-coverts
which
is
blackish
,
becoming
quite
black
close
to
the
tail
;
bill
and
feet
black
;
iris
dark
brown
.
The
female
is
similar
in
plumage
,
but
browner
on
mantle
and
slightly
smaller
,
the
bill
is
larger
,
but
broader
when
seen
from
above
,
and
with
heavier
lower
mandible
.
The
young
are
duller
in
colour
.
There
is
a
large
migration
of
Scandinavian
Hoodies
southwards
at
the
approach
of
winter
,
to
which
fact
we
owe
our
seasonal
visitation
.
The
late
Henry
Stevenson
in
his
"
Birds
of
Norfolk
,
"
says
:
—
"
The
Royston
or
Grey-backed
Crow
,
as
this
species
is
also
called
,
visits
us
in
autumn
in
large
numbers
,
arriving
about
the
first
week
in
October
,
though
occasionally
earlier
,
and
leaves
again
by
the
end
of
March
or
beginning
of
April
.
They
frequent
for
the
most
part
the
broads
and
marshes
near
the
rivers
,
particularly
the
mouths
of
tidal
streams
,
and
are
extremely
numerous
on
the
sea
coast
,
where
they
also
gradually
collect
together
towards
the
time
of
their
departure
in
spring
.
It
is
fortunate
for
Norfolk
that
this
destructive
species
leaves
us
so
regularly
iu
the
breeding-season
,
as
no
greater
enemy
to
the
game-keeper
probably
exists
,
neither
eggs
nor
young
birds
,
nor
indeed
,
in
some
cases
,
old
ones
either
,
being
safe
from
its
pr\-ing
e\'es
and
carnivorons
propensities
.
There
are
,
liowever
,
one
or
two
instances
on
record
of
its
having
remained
to
nest
in
this
neighbourhood
,
but
not
of
late
j-ears
.
"
Mr.
Stevenson
also
quotes
the
following
from
vSt
.
John
's
"
Natural
History
and
Sport
in
Mora}'
,
"
p.
59
:
—
"
It
kills
newlj'-boru
lambs
,
picking
out
the
eyes
and
tongue
while
the
poor
creature
is
still
alive
.
It
preys
on
)-oung
grouse
,
partridges
,
hares
,
etc.
,
and
is
vcr}'
destructive
to
eggs
of
all
sorts
.
In
certain
feeding
spots
in
the
woods
I
have
seen
the
remains
of
eggs
of
the
most
extra-↵ordinary
variety
and
number
.
No
sooner
does
a
wild
duck
,
pheasant
,
or
au}'
bird
leave
its
nest
,
than
the
Hooded
Crow
is
on
the
look-out
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
a
single
pair
often
destroys
many
hundred
eggs
iu
the
course
of
a
season
.
All
birds
seem
aware
of
this
,
and
Peewits
,
Gulls
,
Redshanks
,
etc.
,
attack
most
furiously
an\'
Crow
which
they
see
hunting
near
their
nests
.
The
'
hoody
'
is
also
very
fond
of
young
ducks
,
and
destro3-s
great
numbers
.
In
the
mountains
it
is
bold
enough
to
make
prize
of
the
eggs
of
the
eagle
,
peregrine
falcon
,
or
osprc}'
,
if
the
parent
birds
happen
to
be
driven
off
their
nests
.
"
In
their
"
Notes
from
Redcar
"
(
"
Zoologist
,
"
1893
,
p.
6
)
,
speaking
of
the
immi-↵gration
of
Hoodies
from
the
12th
to
the
30th
of
October
,
Messrs.
T.
H.
Nelson
,
and
F.
Pilling
observe
:
—
"
The
Hoodies
are
generally
noticed
in
largest
numbers
during
thick
weather
in
October
and
November
.
"
According
to
Seebohm
this
species
migrates
b}'
da\-
,
and
Gatke
says
:
—
"
In
the
autumn
,
and
with
favourable
weather
,
the
migration
commences
at
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
with
flocks
of
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
individuals
;
the
movement
soon
passes
into
a
stream
of
flocks
,
consisting
of
from
a
hundred
to
at
least
five
hundred
examples
,
and
continues
in
this
manner
,
without
gaps
of
any
kind
,
until
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
We
can
scarcel}^
in
a
case
of
this
kind
,
assume
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
stream
or
route
of
migration
which
just
chances
to
cross
Heligoland
,
for
the
movement
proceeds
in
equal
magnitude
from
east
to
west
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
.
More
than
this
,
on
days
when
powerful
migrations
of
this
kind
take
place
,
the
migration-front
or
column
has
been
seen
from
boats
eight
miles
north
of
the
island
to
stretch
farther
to
the
north
,
as
far
as
the
limits
of
vision
extend
;
while
on
the
south
it
reached
,
simultaneous!}'
and
in
equal
magnitude
,
up
the
Weser
,
at
least
as
far
as
Bremerhaven
,
as
was
determined
from
the
steamer
which
regularly
plies
between
this
island
and
the
latter
place
.
We
thus
get
a
migration
column
of
at
least
thirty-six
geographical
miles
in
breadth
.
"
Herr
Gatke
proceeds
to
make
many
other
observations
of
considerable
interest
,
which
it
would
be
well
worth
our
readers'
while
to
peruse
,
but
for
which
we
can
not
find
space
here
;
nevertheless
,
his
concluding
paragraphs
are
,
we
consider
,
important
;
as
showing
how
little
the
agency
of
man
can
affect
the
extinction
of
species
,
so
far
as
it
is
directed
merely
against
birds
,
their
nests
and
eggs
:
—
"
Finally
,
I
would
add
one
further
remark
,
as
regards
the
position
of
these
Crows
in
the
econom_v
of
nature
.
Evcr\'where
the
protection
of
birds
creates
the
greatest
interest
,
and
man
is
always
put
in
the
foreground
as
the
greatest
enemy
of
the
feathered
creation
.
Now
,
altliough
the
destruction
of
song-birds
and
other
snuiU
species
,
as
it
appears
to
be
carried
on
in
Italy
,
ought
to
be
resisted
by
all
possible
means
;
nevertheless
all
that
is
offered
for
sale
,
in
the
way
of
eggs
and
small
birds
,
in
Ital}'
during
one
complete
migration
period
,
would
scarcel}'
equal
the
quantity
of
eggs
and
nestlings
destroyed
b}-
the
Hooded
Crows
during
one
single
summer
day
.
"
It
is
perhaps
true
that
the
number
of
individuals
of
Hooded
Crows
becomes
nowhere
apparent
in
such
prepondering
quantity
as
in
Heligoland
,
in
consequence
of
which
their
destructive
influence
is
under-estimated
;
but
if
one
had
the
oppor-↵tunity
of
seeing
the
hosts
of
them
which
travel
past
during
two
months
of
autumn
,
in
uninterrupted
sequence
,
and
return
in
the
spring
,
as
is
the
case
here
,
where
no
tree
,
wood
,
or
hill
,
impedes
the
view
;
and
if
one
at
the
same
time
remembers
that
all
these
fellows
,
impudent
as
thej^
are
cunning
,
do
nothing
else
during
the
long
summer
da3's
,
from
earl}^
dawn
to
sunset
,
but
plunder
the
nests
of
other
birds
,
from
the
Lark
to
the
Eagle
(
Dresser
)
,
one
would
indeed
wonder
that
there
are
still
any
birds
,
other
than
Hooded
Crows
,
left
in
the
world
.
By
all
means
let
us
nurture
and
protect
our
little
bird-friends
in
every
possible
manner
,
more
especially
bj^
abstaining
from
destroying
an}-
small
shrubbery
or
bush
,
the
sole
use
of
which
may
,
perhaps
,
be
that
it
affords
some
small
songster
a
hidden
nook
for
its
nest
;
above
everything
,
however
,
let
us
aim
at
compassing
the
destruction
of
Hooded
Crows
unsparingl}'
,
3'ear
in
year
out
,
b}'
all
the
means
placed
at
our
command
.
"
The
nidification
of
this
species
is
similar
to
that
of
the
Carrion-Crow
;
in
Ireland
it
commences
about
the
middle
of
March
,
but
in
Scotland
later
;
the
nest
does
not
differ
from
that
of
C.
coroue
,
and
is
similarly
situated
,
although
it
has
been
found
built
on
the
roofs
of
huts
,
according
to
Gray
.
The
eggs
are
precisel}^
like
those
of
the
Carrion-Crow
in
all
their
varieties
.
The
cries
of
this
species
and
of
C.
coronc
are
indistinguishable
,
and
the
food
is
the
same
;
but
the
Hooded
Crow
is
bolder
and
even
more
destructive
.
Dixon
is
the
only
Ornithologist
who
seems
to
have
a
good
word
to
saj-
for
this
Crow
;
he
says
:
—
"
I
must
confess
that
,
in
spite
of
the
dark
tales
of
plunder
and
his
questionable
mode
of
getting
a
livelihood
,
the
Hooded
Crow
is
a
favourite
bird
of
mine
,
and
his
habits
and
regular
movements
never
fail
to
interest
me
.
"
Mail}-
readers
of
his
life
have
,
doubtless
,
held
similar
views
willi
regard
to
Jack
Sheppard
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
tliere
appears
to
be
no
redeeming
point
in
the
character
of
the
Hoodie
,
he
is
a
scourge
when
wild
and
when
kept
as
a
pet
;
not
only
useless
,
but
dangerous
so
long
as
he
is
alive
:
when
dead
,
however
,
Herr
Giitke
tells
us
that
the
Heligolanders
esteem
him
as
an
article
of
food
.
Lord
Lilford
sa3's
that
"
the
habits
of
the
bird
are
always
abominable
,
and
although
,
from
the
accident
of
its
not
nesting
in
our
county
,
we
are
not
exposed
to
the
detriment
from
this
thief
to
which
those
dwelling
on
the
other
side
of
the
Tweed
are
subject
,
we
have
no
plea
to
urge
in
defence
of
the
Gre}'
Crow
,
and
hold
him
as
a
sturdy
vagrant
to
be
summarily
dealt
with
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
.
We
should
be
sorry
to
c\ten)ii}iatc
any
bird
;
but
this
one
could
be
better
spared
than
any
other
with
which
we
are
acquainted

The
Rook
.
Corviis
/nigi/i(;i(s
,
Linn
.
IN
Western
Europe
the
Rook
breeds
as
far
to
the
north
as
the
Arctic
circle
,
but
not
so
far
in
the
East
.
It
is
also
found
in
the
summer
throughout
Central
and
Southern
Europe
,
being
resident
in
the
more
southern
portion
of
its
range
,
but
migratory
in
the
more
northern
countries
,
whence
at
the
approach
of
winter
it
retires
to
Southern
Europe
,
North-east
Africa
,
the
Mediterranean
islands
,
and
Asia
Minor
.
Eastwards
it
breeds
in
Western
Siberia
and
Turkestan
,
wintering
in
North
Persia
,
Afghanistan
,
Cashmere
,
and
N.
W.
India
.
In
England
,
Wales
,
and
Ireland
the
Rook
is
prett}^
generally
distributed
in
all
suitable
localities
;
in
Scotland
though
rarer
and
more
local
,
it
is
rapidly
increasing
,
occasionally
wandering
to
the
Outer
Hebrides
and
now
breeding
as
far
north
as
the
Orkneys
and
Shetlands
.
The
male
Rook
is
black
,
glossed
with
purple
,
most
brightly
on
the
upper
parts
.
From
the
base
of
the
bill
is
a
l^are
grey
warty
patch
,
extending
over
the
chin
and
upper
part
of
the
throat
.
Bill
and
feet
black
;
iris
brown
.
Tlie
female
is
slightly
smaller
and
less
glossy
than
the
male
.
Tlie
young
bird
is
still
less
glossy
and
has
the
base
of
the
bill
covered
,
as
in
the
Carrion-Crow
,
with
bristly
feathers
;
it
may
be
distinguished
by
its
more
.slender
bill
and
tlie
deep
flesh-↵colour
of
the
inside
of
the
mouth
,
this
,
however
,
changes
to
.slate
-colour
with
age
.
In
England
the
Rook
is
a
useful
bird
so
long
as
it
can
obtain
a
sufficient
quantity
of
insects
and
their
larvje
to
support
it
and
its
offspring
;
but
when
,
owing
to
protracted
drought
it
can
not
obtain
these
,
it
becomes
somewhat
mischievous
after
the
fashion
of
its
congeners
.
In
Scotland
,
where
pastures
are
somewhat
limited
,
it
is
dreaded
and
detested
almost
as
much
as
the
Carrion-Crow
.
It
is
certain
that
when
pressed
by
hunger
it
will
sacrifice
weak
birds
to
satisfy
its
craving
for
food
;
for
,
as
noted
in
my
"
Handbook
"
I
have
on
several
occasions
witnessed
this
predatory
habit
in
severe
wintry
weather
.
The
Rook
is
essentially
a
gregarious
bird
and
haunts
well-cultivated
districts
,
preferabl}^
where
tall
trees
are
numerous
and
pastures
are
large
;
here
he
may
be
seen
day
after
day
busily
feeding
on
snails
or
digging
for
worms
,
leather-jackets
and
other
noxious
grubs
;
in
the
fallows
,
whilst
he
doubtless
swallows
a
little
grain
,
he
does
incalculable
good
by
destroying
wire-worms
and
larvae
of
cock-↵chafers
,
whilst
in
the
turnip-fields
he
not
onl}'
devours
such
examples
of
the
latter
grubs
as
he
can
find
,
but
does
considerable
execution
upon
the
dreaded
and
destructive
caterpillar
of
a
common
moth
(
Agrotis
segetuin
)
.
The
nests
are
generally
placed
in
the
upper
branches
of
tall
trees
;
either
in
copses
,
plantations
,
pleasure-grounds
,
parks
,
or
when
planted
in
rows
bounding
the
margin
of
a
pasture
,
or
forming
an
avenue
over
a
country
road
;
but
Stevenson
rightly
says
:
—
"
Though
for
the
most
part
selecting
the
tallest
trees
,
and
placing
their
nest
near
the
upper
branches
,
they
will
build
also
on
low
Scotch
firs
,
in
the
most
exposed
situations
,
"
and
he
adds
:
—
"
A
still
more
novel
site
has
also
been
chosen
by
a
few
pairs
at
Spixworth
Park
,
where
,
for
the
last
two
or
three
seasons
,
they
have
built
in
the
tops
of
some
fine
laurustinus
bushes
,
about
twelve
or
foiirteen
feet
from
the
ground
,
and
others
in
a
dwarf
ilex
,
close
to
a
flight
of
stone
steps
,
connecting
one
part
of
the
garden
with
the
other
,
yet
so
low
down
that
the
feeding
of
the
young
was
plainly
visible
fi^om
the
windows
of

When
a
rookery
is
well
established
,
the
birds
are
not
easily
persuaded
to
abandon
it
,
excepting
for
private
reasons
of
their
own
;
moreover
the
continual
noises
of
a
great
city
do
not
seem
to
disturb
them
at
all
,
as
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
Rooks
still
build
and
breed
in
the
old
trees
which
have
been
left
standing
in
the
busiest
parts
of
London
.
*
The
nest
is
usually
connucuced
or
repaired
early
iu
March
,
but
after
unusualh-
mild
winters
building
operations
sometimes
commence
much
earlier
.
After
the
exceptionally
open
winter
of
1895-6
I
saw
several
young
Rooks
sitting
just
outside
the
nests
in
which
the}-
had
been
hatched
as
early
as
the
6th
March
,
whilst
I
had
noticed
the
Rooks
in
a
rookery
close
to
my
house
repairing
their
nests
in
January
,
and
in
Februar}-
a
pair
daily
visited
m^'
garden
for
worms
:
a
friend
of
mine
living
at
Dulwich
first
directed
my
attention
to
the
early
pre-↵parations
for
nesting
made
by
these
birds
,
assuring
me
in
January
that
he
had
seen
a
pair
of
Rooks
carrying
sticks
up
to
their
nest
.
In
the
"
Feathered
World
"
for
April
24th
,
1896
,
Mr.
W.
N.
Rushen
says
:
—
"
I
saw
two
young
Rooks
near
Wanstead
Park
,
on
April
8th
,
which
were
as
strong
on
the
wing
as
their
parents
;
and
,
to
be
as
forward
as
this
,
the}-
must
have
left
the
nest
for
some
weeks
.
"
t
The
structure
is
usually
very
compact
,
formed
of
strong
sticks
and
twigs
,
plastered
with
mud
,
lined
with
turf
,
straw
,
roots
,
and
sometimes
moss
,
dead
leaves
,
and
feathers
.
The
eggs
number
from
three
to
five
and
vary
considerably
both
in
form
and
colouring
,
exhibiting
similar
forms
to
those
of
the
Carrion-↵Crow
;
they
are
,
however
,
noticeably
smaller
.
The
ground-colour
varies
from
pale
-blue
to
green
,
and
is
lighter
or
darker
iu
different
nests
;
the
spotting
is
olive-brown
,
fine
and
sparse
,
or
coarser
and
thicklj'
distributed
over
the
entire
surface
and
sometimes
with
a
few
larger
deep
brown
blotches
or
streaks
.
Of
the
eggs
figured
on
our
plate
,
figs
.
241
and
242
are
from
my
own
collection
,
and
243
and
244
from
that
of
Mr.
A.
B.
Farn
's
.
When
the
young
first
leave
the
nest
they
are
awkward
and
weak
on
their
legs
,
sitting
huddled
on
a
branch
with
their
heads
well
down
between
their
shoulders
;
as
the
wind
sways
the
branch
the}-
tip
forwards
,
and
have
to
open
their
short
wings
to
recover
their
balance
;
but
,
after
daily
short
excursions
from
branch
to
branch
,
the}'
gradually
gather
strength
and
confidence
,
until
finally
they
are
able
to
accompany
their
parents
to
the
fields
and
get
their
first
lesson
in
finding
food
for
themselves
.
To
those
who
have
not
noticed
the
methods
by
which
the
various
species
of
Crows
are
taught
by
their
parents
,
I
can
not
do
better
than
recommend
the
admirable
account
given
by
Mrs.
Olive
Thorne
Miller
in
her
fascinating
book
entitled
"
Little
Brothers
of
the
Air
.
"
*
The
accuracv
of
this
lady
's
observations
will
be
at
once
recognized
by
all
who
have
carefully
studied
the
habits
of
birds
.
The
authoress
'
plea
for
the
Crow
,
at
the
end
of
that
chapter
of
her
book
,
though
true
in
a
measure
of
our
Rook
,
could
not
be
used
in
defence
of
the
Carrion
or
Hooded
Crows
;
she
says
:
—
"
A
Crow
parent
on
a
foraging
ex-↵pedition
is
a
most
unwelcome
visitor
to
the
farmer
with
young
chickens
,
or
the
bird-lover
interested
in
the
fate
of
nestlings
.
Yet
when
I
saw
the
persecuted
creature
in
the
character
of
provider
for
four
hungiy
and
ever
clamorous
mouths
,
to
whose
wants
she
is
as
alive
as
we
are
to
the
wants
of
our
babies
,
I
took
a
new
view
of
Crow
depredations
,
and
could
not
see
why
her
children
should
not
have
a
chicken
or
a
bird
for
breakfast
,
as
well
as
ours
.
Poor
hunted
Crow
,
against
whom
ever}'
man
's
hand
is
raised
!
She
feels
,
with
reason
,
that
every
human
being
is
a
deadly
enemy
thirsting
for
her
life
,
that
every
cylinder
pointed
upwards
is
loaded
with
death
,
that
every
string
is
a
cruel
snare
to
entangle
and
maim
her
—
yet
whose
offspring
,
dear
as
ours
to
us
,
clamour
for
food
.
How-↵should
she
know
that
it
is
wrong
to
eat
chickens
;
or
that
Robin
babies
were
made
to
live
and
grow
up
,
and
Crow
babies
to
die
of
starvation
?
The
farmer
ignores
the
millions
of
insects
she
destroys
,
and
shoots
her
for
the
one
chicken
she
takes
,
though
she
has
been
amply
proved
to
be
one
of
his
most
valuable
servants
.
"
The
note
of
the
Rook
is
usually
carr
,
but
sometimes
catv
,
and
one
of
the
birds
in
a
neighbour
's
rookery
,
born
and
reared
during
incessant
rains
,
seemed
to
have
contracted
a
chronic
cold
,
for
his
note
was
like
that
of
a
Golden
Eagle
,
ar-cc-o
.
The
food
in
summer
consists
of
grain
,
worms
,
snails
,
insects
and
their
larvae
,
and
in
dry-seasons
or
arid
localities
,
of
mice
,
fish
,
mollusca
,
young
birds
,
eggs
,
the
maggots
in
carrion
and
possibly
the
flesh
itself
.
Later
in
the
year
fruits
,
beech-nuts
,
acorns
,
and
berries
;
but
in
winter
,
when
all
these
are
gone
,
it
has
to
get
what
it
can
from
refuse
heaps
or
from
the
scraps
cast
out
from
houses
;
though
,
when
opportunity
offers
,
it
does
not
scruple
to
destroy
sparrows
and
other
small
birds
.
The
Rook
is
not
suitable
either
for
cage
or
aviary
;
ni}-
brother
had
one
for
some
time
,
but
it
was
anything
but
an
interesting
pet
.
Mr.
J.
Lewis
Bonhote
writes
:
—
"
The
Rook
is
harmless
;
but
,
like
the
Carrion-Crow
,
very
sluggish
in
its
movements
;
scarcely
ever
uttering
a
sound
.
It
is
also
very
wild
and
never
attempts
to
talk
,
at
least
that
is
my
experience
.

f
FAMILY
ALAUDIDJ-:
.
THE
position
in
which
Howard
vSannders
has
phiccd
this
faniil_y
does
not
strike
one
as
natural
:
it
would
certainly-
have
fitted
in
better
with
one
's
sense
of
order
in
Nature
,
to
have
seen
it
placed
next
to
the
Motaciilidcc
,
as
in
vSeel)ohm
's
"
History
of
British
Birds
,
"
and
as
evidently
advocated
b}'
Dr.
Sharpc
,
to
judge
by
his
remarks
on
the
family
in
the
"
Catalogue
of
Birds
.
"
It
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
the
Larks
can
be
more
nearly
related
to
the
Crows
than
to
the
Pipits
,
and
one
wishes
that
the
author
of
the
Manual
had
in
his
arrangement
borne
out
vSeebohm
's
opinion
—
"
The
Larks
appear
to
bear
the
same
relation
to
the
Pipits
that
the
Thrushes
do
to
the
Warblers
,
"
or
Jerdon
's
—
"
The
Larks
may
be
said
to
grade
to
the
P'inchcs
on
the
one
hand
,
through
Jloiifijniioi/Ia
and
PUciropluvics
;
and
,
on
the
other
,
into
the
Pipits
through
Corydallar
The
chief
characteristic
of
the
familj-
is
the
scutellation
at
the
back
of
the
tarsus
;
and
it
is
probabl}'
because
of
tliis
peculiarity
(
and
not
becanse
they
are
allied
to
the
Crows
)
,
that
Howard
Sannders
subordinating
his
own
views
,
as
he
sa3-s
,
"
to
those
of
the
majorit}-
of
the
B.
O.
U
.
Committee
re-↵specting
the
positions
of
the
Alaiiiiidic
and
the
Coii'ida
''
has
placed
the
Larks
at
the
end
of
the
Passcrcs
,
all
the
other
groups
having
the
i'eet
scaled
only
in
front
.
The
Larks
are
walking
birds
,
building
and
in
man}'
species
roosting
on
the
ground
:
with
the
exception
of
the
more
arboreal
forms
,
the}-
rarely
perch
on
trees
;
and
when
they
do
,
they
select
the
thicker
branches
.
They
do
not
wash
,
but
dust
themselves
after
the
manner
of
Sparrows
or
Gallinaceous
birds
.
Their
food
consists
of
spiders
,
centipedes
,
insects
,
larvae
,
and
seeds
or
grain
.
Larks
are
powerful
flyers
,
their
wings
being
large
and
pointed
;
the
wings
of
the
males
are
also
as
a
rule
stronger
and
more
elongated
than
those
of
the
females
,
doubtless
to
enable
them
to
maintain
their
soaring
hovering
flight
when
singing
:
as
a
natural
result
of
this
increase
of
wing-power
the
sternum
is
some-↵what
more
prominent
,
giving
greater
fulness
to
the
chest
.
By
these
characters
the
bird-catchers
are
enabled
to
tell
the
sex
of
Larks
directly
they
grasp
them
,
the
male
being
,
in
their
own
words
,
"
a
handful
.
"
Colonel
Charles
Bingham
tells
me
that
the
sex
of
a
Lark
can
always
be
told
by
the
length
of
the
hind
claw
,
which
is
distinctly
longer
in
the
males
than
in
the
females
.
Practically
the
Aluudida
constitute
an
Old
World
fainih'
,
one
species
only
occurring
in
North
America
,
whilst
,
as
Jerdon
observes
,
"
They
are
very
sparingly
represented
in
j\Iala3-ana
and
Australia

FOUND
during
the
summer
months
throughout
the
whole
of
Europe
;
nesting
in
Scandinavia
as
far
north
as
lat
.
70°
,
whilst
in
North
Africa
it
breeds
sparingly
as
far
south
as
the
slopes
of
the
Atlas
Mountains
,
and
in
the
east
,
in
Russia
and
Siberia
,
and
at
high
elevations
in
Japan
,
the
valley
of
the
Amoor
,
South-east
IMongolia
,
Turkestan
and
Persia
.
In
winter
it
visits
China
,
North-west
India
,
Afghanistan
,
Persia
,
Asia
Minor
,
Palestine
and
Egypt
.
It
has
been
met
with
at
Madeira
,
and
is
reputed
to
have
occurred
on
Greenland
.
It
has
also
been
introduced
into
the
United
States
,
*
New
Zealand
and
Australia
.
Throughout
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
,
the
Sky-Lark
is
widely
distributed
,
abundant
,
and
\^excepting
in
the
extreme
north
)
resident
.
The
climatic
variations
of
the
Sky-Lark
have
been
separated
under
several
distinctive
names
,
such
as
A.
dulcivox
,
A.
japonica
,
A.
caiitarclla
,
A.
liopus
,
A.
blak-↵istoni
,
A.
giilgiila
,
A.
australis
,
A.
axlivox
,
A.
ivai/crsi
,
arid
A.
sala
;
but
so
many
intergrades
exist
that
Ornithologists
generally
are
now
content
to
regard
them
as
one
variable
species
.
Our
Sky-Lark
in
breeding-plumage
has
the
upper
parts
golden
brown
,
with
blackish
centres
to
the
feathers
;
edges
of
greater
wing-coverts
paler
;
the
outer-↵most
tail-feather
white
,
with
the
exception
of
a
blackish
streak
on
the
inner
web
;
the
sccuiid
feather
white
on
the
outer
web
only
:
inider
parts
buffish-white
,
spotted
and
streaked
witli
l:)hickish-br(iwu
on
tlie
throat
,
breast
and
flanks
;
bill
dark
brown
above
,
paler
below
;
feet
j-ellowish
-brown
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
is
rather
smaller
than
the
male
,
and
has
shorter
wings
,
but
d(jes
not
differ
in
plumage
:
3-oung
birds
have
broad
buff
tips
to
the
feathers
.
After
the
autumn
moult
both
sexes
are
more
tawn}^
in
colouring
.
In
order
to
tell
the
sex
of
the
Sky- Lark
,
the
London
bird-dealers
take
the
bird
in
the
left
hand
with
the
tail
towards
them
,
and
with
the
right
hand
draw
down
the
wing
until
the
point
of
the
first
long
primar}'
touches
the
tip
of
the
outer-↵most
tail-feather
:
the
wing
of
the
male
being
distinctl}-
longer
than
that
of
the
female
,
the
so-called
"
shoulder
"
then
appears
to
be
much
more
angular
in
the
former
than
in
the
latter
se.\
.
I
have
seen
considerable
numbers
of
birds
thus
tested
,
the
males
being
caged
and
the
females
returned
to
the
catchers
,
and
I
never
knew
the
test
to
fail
:
but
females
are
rarely
forwarded
b}-
experienced
bird-↵catchers
,
most
of
them
being
killed
at
the
nets
and
sold
to
the
poulterers
.
Although
abundant
enough
on
moors
and
commons
,
downs
,
grassy
cliffs
,
and
even
mountains
,
the
Sky-Lark
certainly
prefers
arable
land
,
pastures
,
and
parks
:
it
seems
especially
to
delight
in
fields
of
clover
:
it
shuns
all
places
thickly
studded
with
trees
,
such
as
woods
,
copses
,
and
plantatious
,
but
is
almost
always
to
be
met
with
in
country
cemeteries
.
Excepting
when
in
pursuit
of
another
iudividual
of
its
own
species
,
the
flight
of
the
Sky-Lark
does
not
strike
one
as
being
particularly
rapid
;
it
is
somewhat
undulating
,
and
there
is
a
fluttering
motion
,
even
when
it
is
crossing
a
field
,
which
is
ver3'
characteristic
.
The
male
,
when
soaring
,
always
commences
its
upward
flight
with
this
butterfly-like
hovering
action
,
and
sometimes
it
is
continued
until
it
reaches
its
highest
elevation
;
at
other
times
it
rises
obliquel}-
and
rapidl}'
,
its
song
the
whole
time
fitting
its
movements
:
in
its
descent
it
sometimes
drops
abruptly
perhaps
for
forty
or
fifty
feet
,
pauses
a
second
and
drops
again
,
making
perhaps
three
or
four
stages
in
its
fall
,
until
,
as
it
nears
the
ground
,
it
flutters
round
in
a
half-circle
to
the
earth
;
each
drop
being
accompanied
by
the
finishing
shrill
'ivhcc
,
tvhee
,
w/icc
of
its
song
:
often
it
comes
down
with
a
wide
graceful
sweep
.
The
nest
is
placed
in
a
depression
in
the
ground
,
generall}-
amongst
growing
crops
,
often
merely
sheltered
on
one
side
b}'
an
overhanging
tuft
of
coarse
grass
or
other
vegetation
,
and
sometimes
without
any
shelter
whatever
;
a
singular
nest
with
a
kind
of
lid
formed
of
water-weed
,
which
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
a
shepherd
in
the
Isle
of
Sheppy
,
is
described
in
my
"
Handbook
.
"
The
nest
itself
is
more
or
less
loosely
constructed
of
dried
bents
and
dead
grass
,
and
lined
with
finer
grass-stalks
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
five
,
and
sometimes
three
may
be
found
incubated
,
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
so
small
a
number
ever
represents
a
full
clutch
:
in
ground-colour
they
vary
a
good
deal
—
white
,
whity-brown
,
huffish
clay-coloured
,
or
pale
olive-green
;
generally
densely
mottled
with
olive
or
smok}'
grey-brown
over
the
entire
surface
,
but
frequently
with
a
denser
zone
at
the
larger
,
and
more
rarely
at
the
smaller
end
;
sometimes
there
are
a
few
scattered
streaks
and
spots
of
deeper
brown
.
The
most
aberrant
egg
whicli
I
have
seen
was
one
lent
to
me
for
illustration
in
my
"
Handbook
"
(pi
.
XI
,
fig
.
11
)
,
which
bears
a
curious
resemblance
to
some
eggs
of
the
Common
Bunting
;
it
is
white
with
a
deep
brown
patch
at
the
larger
end
,
shading
into
sieuua
and
slightly
macular
along
its
inferior
margin
.
Although
the
Sky-Lark
pairs
in
March
,
nidification
does
not
commence
until
late
in
April
,
nests
being
most
numerous
towards
the
end
of
]\Iay
;
two
broods
are
reared
in
the
year
,
the
second
nest
being
furnished
with
eggs
late
in
June
or
early
in
Jul)'
.
Both
male
and
female
are
very
wary
in
approaching
their
nest
,
never
descending
close
to
it
,
but
at
some
distance
,
whence
they
may
be
seen
threading
their
way
in
the
most
irregular
fashion
in
and
out
of
the
herbage
towards
it
.
This
is
best
seen
where
the
nest
is
somewhat
exposed
on
an
open
pasture
,
the
niothcr-l)ird
wanders
about
apparently
in
the
most
aimless
fashion
,
but
constantly
approaching
the
nest
until
about
a
foot
from
it
,
when
she
makes
straight
for
it
and
settles
down
.
By
watching
patiently
through
a
glass
one
can
thus
sometimes
discover
the
nest
.
The
Sky-Lark
's
soug
is
so
much
admired
and
so
well-known
that
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
describe
it
;
it
consists
mainly
of
a
shaking
water-bubble
trill
,
inter-↵spersed
with
long
drawn
notes
,
and
is
marvellously
exhilarating
,
considering
how
little
variety
there
is
in
it
.
The
bird
sings
either
soaring
,
or
perched
on
a
stump
or
a
thick
branch
.
In
the
summer
the
food
of
the
Sky-Lark
consists
of
spiders
,
insects
,
their
larvae
,
and
worms
;
but
in
winter
,
and
more
especially
during
frosty
weather
,
it
gets
little
else
but
seeds
of
grasses
,
plantain
,
etc
.
During
the
latter
season
this
species
is
very
gregarious
in
its
habits
,
and
consequently
immense
numbers
are
netted
,
the
male
birds
iisually
realizing
from
gd
.
to
is
.
apiece
,
according
to
whether
they
are
disposed
of
to
dealers
or
private
persons
;
the
females
,
as
already
stated
,
are
generally
killed
for
the
table
.
In
1886
,
I
made
my
first
attempt
at
rearing
Sky-Larks
from
the
nest
:
I
obtained
seven
young
birds
about
eight
days
old
,
and
at
first
kept
them
in
a
basket
of
hay
;
but
no
sooner
was
this
opened
than
these
active
little
things
bounded
out
like
grasshoppers
,
often
clearing
my
shoulders
and
alighting
on
the
floor
behind
me
.
This
I
considered
dangerous
,
and
,
therefore
,
bought
a
long
"
Lark-↵runuer
,
"
an
elongated
cage
about
two
feet
in
length
,
by
nine
inches
high
,
wired
in
front
only
.
In
one
corner
I
fixed
a
Sedge-Warbler
's
nest
,
put
ui}'
birds
in
cue
]jy
one
,
keeping
my
hand
over
to
prevent
their
jumping
out
until
all
were
inside
,
when
I
covered
them
with
a
warm
flannel
.
When
they
began
to
get
hungry
off
went
the
blanket
and
the
whole
family
tumbled
out
of
bed
and
stood
in
a
row
in
front
of
the
door
shouting
—
lec-it
,
tcc-u
,
tic-ii
;
and
after
their
meal
they
raced
up
and
down
their
cage
until
wear}-
,
and
tlien
tumbled
back
into
bed
and
I
covered
them
up
again
.
They
seemed
strong
and
sound
,
but
one
by
one
the}'
got
cramp
and
died
until
I
had
lost
them
all
.
I
subsequentl}'
purchased
a
3'oung
male
and
an
old
female
and
at
first
kept
them
together
,
but
finding
that
they
did
not
get
on
well
together
I
separated
them
,
keeping
the
male
bird
in
an
ordinary-
Lark-cage
and
the
female
in
an
aviary
where
she
contented
herself
with
running
backwards
and
forwards
continually
over
about
a
foot
of
ground
,
never
fl\ing
,
excepting
when
startled
,
when
she
flew
up
recklessly
and
fell
back
regardless
of
consecjuences
to
the
detriment
of
her
plumage
.
The
male
turned
out
a
good
singer
and
was
so
tame
that
he
used
to
peck
and
pull
at
my
finger
when
I
put
it
through
the
wires
;
he
was
also
very
intelligent
and
would
claw
the
wires
and
look
round
at
a
bottle
containing
watercress
,
of
which
he
was
very
fond
,
evidently
asking
me
to
give
him
some
.
In
July
,
1 88 7
,
I
obtained
two
nestling
Sky-Larks
and
brought
them
up
upon
my
Nightingale
food
,
and
in
October
they
both
began
to
sing
,
but
one
of
them
died
the
following
year
;
the
other
made
a
grand
singer
,
and
used
to
introduce
the
song
of
the
Persian
Bulbul
into
the
middle
of
its
performance
:
it
lived
for
several
years
.
In
May
,
1888
,
I
took
a
nest
of
three
young
Larks
when
they
were
only
six
days
old
(
I
first
saw
them
as
eggs
)
and
was
obliged
to
take
them
when
I
did
,
as
I
was
then
returning
home
.
Although
they
all
had
a
touch
of
cramp
,
I
success-↵fully
reared
them
,
but
during
their
autumn
moult
two
of
them
died
;
the
third
,
which
was
a
wonderfully
tame
little
bird
,
I
turned
loose
in
an
aviary
where
it
was
quite
happy
;
it
used
to
strut
about
in
a
consequential
manner
with
its
crest
up
,
and
although
it
was
a
small
bird
it
sang
so
well
that
I
felt
certain
it
must
be
a
cock
and
never
examined
it
;
eventually
it
settled
the
point
by
laying
an
egg
.
This
bird
was
very
fond
of
perching
upon
a
branch
with
the
long
hind
toe
and
claw
hanging
straight
down
over
the
back
of
it
,
but
it
always
roosted
on
the
earth
after
the
manner
of
its
species
.
*
Judging
by
mj^
own
experience
of
rearing
Sky-Larks
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
a
turf
in
the
cage
,
with
a
hole
cut
in
it
,
and
a
Whitethroat
's
nest
fixed
therein
is
an
advantage
;
the
young
birds
at
first
sleep
in
the
nest
,
but
as
they
get
older
the}-
crouch
down
on
the
turf
,
and
the
moist
warmth
seems
to
lessen
the
tendency
to
cramp
;
but
I
am
sure
that
another
and
a
more
important
thing
is
to
give
them
food
containing
plenty
of
egg
and
moistened
ants
'
cocoons
.
When
adult
,
two
or
three
mealworms
a
day
,
a
handful
of
canar}'
and
millet-seed
once
a
week
,
and
watercress
when
obtainable
,
should
be
given
in
addition
to
the
usual
soft
food
.
I
think
it
was
in
the
winter
of
1891-2
that
my
man
,
having
nothing
else
to
do
,
took
my
nets
out
and
brought
me
home
thirteen
Sky-Larks
,
in
addition
to
a
few
other
birds
;
about
eight
of
these
proved
to
be
cock
birds
,
and
I
selected
the
three
best
singers
as
cage-birds
;
one
of
these
I
finally
retained
,
parting
with
the
remainder
to
friends
.
This
bird
was
always
tame
and
healthy
:
he
lived
in
a
two
foot
"
runner
,
"
half
turfed
and
half
sanded
;
he
was
a
grand
singer
,
producing
the
wild
song
so
perfectly
,
that
if
you
shut
3'our
eyes
you
could
imagine
his
upward
flight
,
and
finally
his
dropping
notes
as
he
i-eturned
to
earth
.
Towards
the
end
of
1895
he
failed
to
get
well
through
his
moult
,
and
one
morning
I
found
him
dead
with
his
head
under
his
wing
.
Mr.
Seebohm
's
account
of
the
migration
of
Sky-Larks
as
observed
by
him
in
Heligoland
is
exceedingly
interesting
;
but
unfortunately
I
have
not
space
to
quote
it
here
.
Speaking
of
the
complaints
respecting
the
diminution
of
birds
,
Herr
Gatke
saj'S
:
—
"
To
a
witness
,
however
,
of
the
enormous
passage
of
migrants
,
of
the
myriads
of
individuals
which
on
autumn
nights
travel
past
this
island
,
like
the
flakes
of
a
snow-storm
,
not
only
within
the
area
of
the
lighthouse
,
but
for
miles
north
and
south
out
to
sea
,
these
complaints
seem
quite
incomprehensible
.
It
is
surely
impossible
that
the
hand
of
man
can
exercise
any
perceptible
influence
on
such
enormous
migration
streams
"
;
and
he
adds
that
the
number
of
15,000
Larks
caught
in
one
autumn
night
does
not
approximately
express
a
proportion
of
one
for
each
10,000
individuals
of
such
a
migrant
stream
.

In
Great
Britain
the
Wood-Lark
is
by
no
means
a
common
bird
,
and
is
very
local
in
its
distribution
;
occurring
chiefly
on
undulating
sandy
or
chalky
soil
dotted
about
with
small
woods
,
copses
,
or
plantations
.
It
is
most
frequently
to
be
met
with
in
suitable
localities
in
the
southern
counties
of
England
and
Wales
;
six
specimens
have
been
obtained
on
the
Scilly
Islands
;
but
has
,
from
time
to
time
,
occurred
in
most
of
the
northern
counties
.
In
Scotland
it
is
very
scarce
,
but
has
once
been
stated
to
have
bred
in
Stirlingshire
.
A
few
appeared
from
early
in
November
to
about
the
middle
of
December
,
on
Fair
Isle
,
in
1906
.
In
Ireland
it
is
principally
confined
to
the
east
and
south
.
In
general
colouring
the
Wood-Lark
nearly
resembles
the
Sky-Lark
,
but
can
always
be
distinguished
both
when
perching
and
on
the
wing
by
its
short
tail
.
It
is
also
smaller
and
has
a
more
slender
bill
;
the
bastard
primary
is
much
longer
;
the
blackish
centres
to
the
feathers
of
the
iipper
surface
are
wanting
on
the
rump
and
upper
tail-coverts
,
the
primary-coverts
have
white
tips
;
central
tail-↵feathers
reddish-brown
,
with
dusky
centres
,
outermost
feather
brown
,
the
outer
web
dusky
at
the
tip
,
the
inner
web
with
a
broad
black
patch
;
remaining
feathers
blackish
,
with
terminal
triangular
white
spots
;
a
broad
buffish-white
superciliary
stripe
extending
backwards
to
the
nape
;
ear-coverts
rufous
,
with
darker
upper
margin
;
cheeks
and
throat
whitish
,
becoming
distinctl}'
yellowish-buff
on
the
breast
and

;

and
flanks
broadly
streaked
;
bill
dark

below
;

;

.
The
female
differs
soniewhal
as
in
the
Sk3'
-Lark
;
the
wing
being
deeidedly
shorter
in
this
sex
than
in
the
male
.
Yonng
l:)irds
are
more

the

the
different
character
of
the
nostrils
(
in
this
species
)
which
are
half
exposed

operculum
,
Dr.
vSharpe
and
others
have
separated
it
as
a
distinct
genus
—
Lullula

Kaup

doubtless
suggested
by
the
French

"
a
name
given
as

indication
of

flute-like
notes
.
Col.
L.
H.
I.
Irb}'
,
in
his
"
Ornithology
of
the
Straits
of
Gibraltar
,
"
sa3'S
that
"
on
the
Andalucian
side
the
Wood-Lark
is
sparingly
and
locally
distributed
during
the
winter
months
up
to
as
late
as
the
21st
of
April
,
frequenting
scrub
where
not
\&xy
thick
,
a
favourite
locality
near
Gibraltar
being
the
Chaparaks
(
ground
covered
with
brushwood
)
in
the
Cork-wood
.
Well-known
to
the
vSpanish
bird-catchers
,
and
highly
valued
as
a
cage-bird
;
they
assured
me
that
the
Wood-↵Lark
never
remains
to
nest
near
Gibraltar
,
but
they
arc
known
to
breed
near
Malaga
.
"
The
Wood-Lark
is
onl}'
to
be
found
in
timbered
country
;
not
that
it
confines
itself
strictly
to
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
woods
,
or
clearings
in
plantations
,
parks
,
and
groves
,
although
these
are
its
favourite
resorts
;
for
it
also
frequents
commons
;
but
trees
appear
to
be
necessary'
to
its
happiness
,
and
where
these
do
not
exist
it
will
not
be
met
with
.
Although
very
fond
of
perching
on
the
branches
of
trees
,
the
Wood-Lark
feeds
principally
on
the
ground
,
where
it
also
roosts
and
builds
its
nest
.
The
latter
is
placed
in
a
depression
in
the
earth
,
sometimes
under
a
grass-tussock
or
small
bush
;
it
is
more
compactl}'
built
than
that
of
the
Sk^^
-Lark
;
sometimes
of
couch-grass
and
a
little
moss
,
with
finer
grass
and
a
little
hair
for
a
lining
;
sometimes
wholly
of
grass
bents
,
the
finer
ones
forming
the
lining
.
The
eggs
,
which
in
this
country
are
often
deposited
by
the
middle
of
March
,
are
apparently
not
laid
in
Central
Spain
until
the
beginning
of
May
(
Lilford
)
or
in
the
Parnassus
until
the
third
week
in
that
month
(
Secholiin
)
:
they
number
from
four
to
five
,
and
are
huffish-
or
greenish-white
,
spotted
with
reddish-brown
,
or
brownish-lilac
,
and
with
underlying
greyer
spots
:
as
with
the
allied
species
they
may
either
be
evenly
distributed
over
the
entire
surface
,
or
more
densely
massed
at
the
extremities
,
or
in
a
zone
near
the
larger
end
;
as
a
rule
,
however
,
the
spots
are
smaller
and
less
confluent
than
in
eggs
of
the
Sky-Lark
,
those
of
the
Wood-Lark
being
generall}'
admitted
to
more
nearly'
resemble
some
varieties
of
those
of
the
Crested
Lark
.
The
Wood-Lark
is
double-brooded
,
and
I
have
never
been
out
of
town
cjuite
eaidy
enough
for
the
first
brood
.
The
food
of
this
bird
is
exactly
similar
to
that
of
the
Sky- Lark
,
consisting
chiefly
of
insects
in
summer
,
and
seeds
in
winter
.
The
Wood-Lark
's
song
is
ver^'
pnre
and
melodious
and
b}-
man}^
it
is
con-↵sidered
only
second
to
that
of
the
Nightingale
,
but
it
certaiul}'
is
not
so
full
of
variety
as
the
song
of
that
bird
;
nevertheless
it
has
the
merit
of
being
persevered
in
throughout
the
year
,
excepting
during
the
moulting
season
;
it
is
usually
commenced
,
and
sometimes
completed
,
from
the
branch
of
a
tree
;
but
more
frequently
the
tree
only
represents
the
point
at
which
the
flight-song
begins
:
the
last
time
that
I
heard
the
flute-like
music
of
this
bird
at
liberty
,
I
was
down
at
Dover
with
mj-
old
friend
Dr.
John
Grayling
,
of
Sittiugbourne
;
we
were
approaching
a
wood
when
,
from
a
tree
at
the
side
of
the
road
,
we
heard
the
delightful
song
of
a
Wood-Lark
;
looking
up
we
soon
espied
him
on
a
branch
and
were
able
to
identify
him
without
difficulty
by
his
short
tail
and
promineut
eye-streak
.
Presently
he
soared
awaj^
rising
at
first
obliquely
and
then
gradually
swinging
round
,
still
singing
,
aud
rising
until
he
had
reached
the
height
of
his
ambition
,
when
with
wide
spiral
curves
he
descended
to
the
earth
.
The
Wood-↵Lark
is
said
sometimes
to
sing
throughout
the
night
,
and
it
certainlj?
does
sing
well
into
the
"
gloaming
,
"
which
has
led
rustics
at
times
to
confound
it
with
the
Nightingale
;
but
,
by
careless
observers
,
it
is
much
more
generally
confused
with
the
Tree- Pipit
.
Although
this
bird
sometimes
soars
quite
as
high
as
the
Sky-Lark
this
is
not
its
general
habit
;
moreover
it
flies
more
in
circles
and
descends
to
the
earth
in
a
wide
spiral
,
instead
of
obliquely
or
b}'
jerky
drops
.
As
a
cage-bird
,
the
Wood-Lark
is
a
great
favourite
,
and
I
have
possessed
two
adult
specimens
.
On
one
occasion
when
driving
through
a
country
road
in
Kent
,
with
woods
on
either
side
,
a
young
bird
was
seen
scampering
and
leaping
to
get
out
of
our
way
.
The
driver
pulled
up
and
succeeded
in
catching
it
for
me
;
but
although
it
soon
fed
itself
and
to
repletion
,
it
quickly
got
cramp
and
died
.
Later
on
,
in
June
1887
,
my
son
aud
I
caught
sight
of
a
slightly
older
example
of
this
species
in
a
somewhat
similar
situation
and
exerted
ourselves
to
catch
it
,
but
it
made
for
a
tall
hawthorn
hedge
,
up
which
it
escaped
with
such
rapidity
,
that
before
we
could
come
up
with
it
,
the
bird
was
out
of
our
reach
.
About
September
,
1894
,
I
was
beautifully
taken
in
by
an
unprincipled
bird-catcher
:
he
had
told
me
of
a
lovely
Wood-Lark
which
he
had
,
and
which
he
described
as
singing
splendidly
.
One
dark
night
he
knocked
at
my
front
door
and
told
me
he
had
brought
this
bird
,
which
I
could
have
for
three
shillings
.
I
put
my
hand
through
the
opening
at
the
top
of
the
cage
,
and
took
the
bird
out
;
it
had
a
short
tail
,
but
(
even
in
the
dark
)
looked
somewhat
uncann}'
;
however
,
he
told
me
he
was
quite
certain
that
it
was
a
Wood-Lark
,
so
I
gave
him
the
money
:
he
hurried
off
so
quickly
that
I
doubted
again
;
and
,
taking
it
in-↵doors
to
the
light
,
I
discovered
that
the
bird
was
a
hen
Sky-Lark
whose
tail
had
been
pulled
out
and
had
half-grown
again
.
I
could
not
help
laughing
,
but
I
never
bought
a
bird
from
that'
man
afterwards
.

have
been

,
one
in

;
one

from
a

in

and
that

.
*
It
is
also
reported
from

.
There
are
many
slight
climatic
modifications
of
this
Lark
,
all
of
which
have
been
regarded
either
as
species
or
subspecies
.
Tlie
typical

has
the

greyish-brown
,
watli
darker

to
the
feathers
,
excepting
on
the
rump

;
and
the
second
feather
which
has
a

margin
to
the

web
;
the
superciliary
stripe
is
broad
,
extending
far
backwards
from
above
the
eye
,
and
is
buffish-white
;
the
under

The
female
has

and
has

Col.
Irb}-
,
in
his
"
Ornithology
of
the
Straits
of
Gibraltar
"
gives
the
following
account
of
this
species
:
—
"
The
Crested
Lark
is
one
of
the
most
abundant
birds
both
in
Morocco
and
Andalucia
,
though
never
seen
in
any
great
numbers
together
.
They
arc
distributed
in
pairs
on
every
road-track
and
open
plain
,
often
at
intervals
of
onl}'
some
twenty
yards
.
Excessively
tame
and
fear-↵less
,
they
have
acquired
the
name
of
Curiiicit)
,
from
their
habit
of
frequenting
roads
,
to
which
they
resort
as
much
on
account
of
the
horse
and
mule-dung
,
at
which
they
are
to
be
seen
pecking
,
as
for
the
purpose
of
dusting
themselves
;
and
they
are
often
to
be
noticed
on
the
sea-shore
,
running
about
like
a
Sauderling
within
a
yard
of
the
water
.
They
have
no
song
worthy
of
the
name
,
and
are
altogether
rather
vulgar
and
uninteresting
birds
.
This
species
is
one
of
those
which
I
could
not
detect
migrating
in
the
slightest
degree
.
The
Crested
Lark
usually
commences
to
lay
about
the
20th
of
April
,
placing
the
nest
in
some
tuft
of
grass
or
under
shelter
of
a
small
stone
or
clod
of
eart
—
constructing
it
,
like
those
of
other
Larks
,
with
bits
of
grass
,
bents
,
etc.
,
lined
with
hair
.
"
Howard
Saunders
says
:
- —
"
The
nest
,
often
commenced
early
in
March
,
is
usually
placed
in
some
such
depression
of
the
dry
ground
as
a
hoof-print
,
or
amongst
herbage
,
but
sometimes
on
an
old
wall
or
bank
of
earth
,
or
even
on
the
ridge
of
a
low
thatched
shed
in
the
fields
;
the
materials
employed
being
diy
grass
and
roots
.
The
eggs
four
to
five
in
number
,
vary
from
greyish-white
distinctly
spotted
with
brown
and
violet-grey
,
to
greenish-grey
mottled
with
olive-↵brown
;
average
measurements
'95
by
"bS
in
.
Incubation
,
in
wdiich
the
male
takes
part
,
lasts
a
fortnight
.
The
Crested
Lark
is
a
tame
and
conspicuous
bird
,
frequenting
sandj^
roads
—
in
which
it
is
fond
of
dusting
itself
—
and
running
with
great
rapidit}'
,
while
I
have
often
seen
it
glide
beneath
a
horse
wlien
at
a
slow
walk
,
rather
than
take
wing
.
Its
flight
is
undulating
and
resembles
that
of
the
Wood-Lark
.
It
is
not
gregarious
,
and
is
generall}'
seen
singly
,
(U-
iu
pairs
and
fauiily
parties
.
The
short
but
rather
liquid
and
melodious
song
of
the
male
is
generally
uttered
on
the
ground
,
though
often
duriug
a
short
flight
,
and
occasion-↵ally
from
a
bush
;
the
note
may
be
syllabled
as
'
coo-hai
.
'
The
young
are
fed
on
insects
and
their
larvae
,
but
seeds
and
grain
form
the
principal
food
of
this
species
,
and
in
snowy
weather
it
may
be
seen
examining
horse
droppings
,
etc
.

for
perhaps

so

the

"
Speaking

"
"
feeds
on
various
insects
,
chiefly
grass-↵hoppers
,
and
in

of
this
food
,
on
grains
and
seeds
.
"
In
his
"
Birds
of
India
,
"
vol
.
II
,
p.
437
,
he
gives
the
following
account
:
—
"
It
is
not
known
in
Bengal
nor
iu
the
Himalayas
,
nor
iu
the
countries
to
the
eastward
.
It
prefers
dry
open
sandy
plaius
,
or
ploughed
land
,
to
grass
,
wet
meadows
,
or
cultivation
.
It
rises
in
the
air
singing
,
though
not
so
high
as
A.
guli^iila
*
nor
is
its
song
so
flue
.
In
winter
it
may
be
seen
in
small
parties
,
or
sometimes
iu
considerable
flocks
,
occasionally
on
roads
and
barren
places
.
"
From
what
Jerdon
says
,
the
"
Chendul
"
as
the
Hindoos
call
the
species
is
much
esteemed
on
account
of
its
song
(
although
Seebohm
states
that
the
latter
is
short
and
monotonous
,
not
unlike
that
of
a
Corn- Bunting
)
he
observes
:
"
It
is
frequently
caged
in
all
parts
of
the
country
,
and
the
bird
is
kept
in
darkness
by
several
layers
of
cloth
wrapped
round
the
cage
;
the
custom
being
to
wrap
an
additional
cover
round
the
cage
every
year
.
In
this
state
it
sings
very
sweetly
,
and
learns
to
imitate
most
exactly
the
notes
of
various
other
birds
,
and
of
animals
,
such
as
the
yelping
of
a
dog
,
the
mewing
of
a
cat
,
the
call
of
a
hen
to
her
chickens
,
etc.
,
etc
.
"
Herr
Rausch
speaks
of
the
Crested
Lark
as
an
original
songster
,
but
considers
that
,
as
regards
its
adult
wild
song
it
is
an
insignificant
and
almost
worthless
singer
.
Perhaps
Herr
Rausch
,
like
Seebohm
,
may
only
have
heard
the
bird
sing
like
a
Corn-Bunting
,
aud
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
different
races
of
the
species
vary
considerabl}'
as
regards
the
excellence
of
their
performance
.
This
we
know
to
be
tlie
case
with
PyauviotKs
Icucotis
the
Persian
specimens
of
wliich
have
a
fine
variable
liquid
song
,
whereas
the
smaller
examples
found
in
N.W
.
India
are
very
poor
singers
.
Judging
b}^
Jerdou
's
account
,
the
Crested
Lark
of
India
can
be
little
inferior
to
the
Mongolian
or
Tientsin
Lark
,
the
song
of
which
,
though
it
contains
some
harsh
scolding
notes
,
is
exceedingly
amusing
and
in
some
of
its
phrases
really
fine
.
My
advice
to
aviculturists
would
,
therefore
,
be
,
not
to
accept
Mr.
Rausch
's
decision
as
final
;
but
,
if
the}'
desire
to
keep
the
Crested
Lark
,
import
it
from
India
,
or
even
from
Pekin
,
where
according
to
Pere
David
(
P.Z.S
.
187 1
,
p.
390
)
it
is
resident
and
common
,
as
it
also
is
in
Mongolia
.
In
India
this
bird
,
according
to
Jerdon
(
cf
.
Cat
.
Birds
,
E.
Ind
.
Comp.
,
vol
.
II
,
p.
466
)
"
feeds
on
various
insects
,
chiefly
grasshoppers
,
and
in
default
of
this
food
,
on
grain
and
seeds
.
"
This
supports
the
statement
made
by
Seebohm
—
"
The
food
of
the
Crested
Lark
does
not
differ
from
that
of
its
congeners
.
In
the
spring
and
summer
it
is
chiefly
composed
of
insects
and
larvae
,
and
in
the
autumn
and
winter
of
various
small
seeds
and
grain
.
"
It
is
exactly
what
one
would
expect
.
In
captivity
it
should
have
soft
food
,
seeds
(
Canary
and
millet
)
,
also
insects
,
mealworms
,
etc
.

:
of
these
one
was
obtained
on
the
Scilly
Islands
,
one
in
Hampshire
,
four
in
Sussex
,
one
in
Cambridge
,
and
one
in
Shropshire
:
in
1890
one
caught
near
Portsmouth
was
exhibited
at
the
Crystal
Palace
.
In
1904
,
a
female
was
caught
on
the
Outer
Hebrides
,
and
it
has
occurred
once
in
Ireland
.
The
general
colouring
of
the
male
in
breeding-plumage
is
pale
rufous
or
sand3'-browu
,
with
dark
brown
centres
to
the
feathers
;
the
central
tail-feathers
are
smoky-brown
,
the
remainder
blackish
,
but
the
two
outer
feathers
have
pale
huffish
patches
,
similar
to
the
white
patches
on
the
tail
of
the
Sky-Lark
;
a
white
superciliary
streak
;
under
parts
white
,
suffused
with
pale
buff
on
the
breast
and
flanks
;
a
few
dark
streaks
on
the
sides
of
tlie
neck
;
bill
dark
brown
,
paler
below
;
feet
j^ellowish
horn-brown
;
iris
hazel
.
The
female
resembles
the
male
in
plumage
,
but
is
peculiar
in
having
both
wing
and
tail
longer
than
in
the
male
.
The
young
have
all
the
feathers
of
the
upper
parts
tipped
and
bordered
with
buff
.
After
the
autumn
moult
the
plumage
is
redder
.
Colonel
Irby
(
"
Ornithology

the
Straits
of
Gibraltar
"
)
says
:
—
"
On
the
Andalucian
side.
of
the
Straits
the
spring
arrival
commences
about
the
middle
of
March
,
and
the
passage
continues
for
a
month
later
,
at
which
time
nests
with
eggs
may
be
found
near
Gibraltar
.
Excessively
abundant
,
as
above
stated
,
in
the
same
situations
as
the
Cahuidra
;
they
prefer
falhnv
i^round
,
nesting
under
shelter
of
some
clod
or
in
au}'
sliglit
depression
of
the
ground
.
I
never
could
find
the
nest
,
except
by
putting
the
old
l)ird
off
.
"
Howard
Saunders
says
:
—
"
During
the
breeding-season
the
liird
frequents
dry
and
sandy
soil
,
and
plains
where
the
herbage
is
somewhat
scanty
;
while
its
tameuess
is
such
as
often
to
cause
difficult}'
in
shooting
a
specimen
for
identification
withoiit
blowing
it
to
pieces
,
and
I
have
seen
a
bird
cut
down
with
a
whip
in
the
road
.
The
male
utters
his
short
and
feeble
song
while
perched
on
some
clod
or
low
wall
,
or
during
a
brief
,
undulating
,
and
somewhat
jerk}'
flight
.
In
autumn
and
winter
large
flocks
are
formed
.
"
The
season
of
nidification
,
as
Seebohm
has
pointed
out
,
of
the
Short-toed
Lark
varies
,
commencing
at
dates
decided
by
the
conditions
of
climate
in
the
countries
where
it
spends
its
summer
;
in
the
warmer
regions
it
begins
as
early
as
April
,
whilst
in
colder
countries
nesting
operations
may
be
delayed
until
June
.
The
nest
,
like
that
of
all
its
allies
,
is
in
a
slight
depression
on
the
ground
,
sometimes
barely
sheltered
by
irregularities
of
the
soil
,
but
frequently
as
with
other
Larks
,
placed
amongst
grass
or
partly
sheltered
by
a
bush
.
It
is
of
the
ordinary
type
,
and
consists
of
grass-bents
,
rootlets
,
down
,
and
sometimes
feathers
with
a
few
hairs
as
a
finish
to
the
lining
.
The
eggs
as
well
as
the
nest
are
very
similar
to
those
of
our
Sky-Lark
,
excepting
in
their
inferior
size
,
and
(
as
is
the
case
with
that
bird
)
a
nest
will
sometimes
only
contain
a
clutch
of
three
;
but
I
have
always
considered
it
probable
,
when
the
normal
number
of
eggs
is
from
four
to
five
,
as
with
the
Short- toed
and
Sky-Larks
,
that
the
bird
has
been
disturbed
in
its
first
nest
and
has
had
to
build
again
in
a
hurry
.
In
colouring
the
eggs
are
creamy-whitish
freely
sprinkled
with
pale
smoky-brown
spots
and
with
greyer
shell-spots
;
these
markings
are
more
or
less
dense
in
different
specimens
,
sometimes
almost
concealing
the
ground-↵tint
and
often
with
a
zone
of
heavier
marking
near
the
larger
end
;
but
these
variations
are
common
to
all
the
Larks
and
might
almost
be
taken
for
granted
.

:
—
"
This

appears
on

in
October
.
It
associates
in

,
and
is
fond
of
damp
spots
,
as
at
the

;
it
also
frequents
grain-fields
,
and
almost
always
retires
to
them
for
shelter
during
the
heat
of
the
day
;
from
whence
it
does
not
in

issue
again
till

he
adds
the
following
facts
:
—
"
It
feeds
almost
entirely
on
seeds
;
both
runs
and
hops
on
the
ground
,
and
has
a
call-note
like
that
of
the
real
Lark
's
.
Towards
the
end
of
March
in
the
south
.
April
in
the
north
of
India
,
different
flocks
often
nnite
into
vast
troops
,
containing
man}'
tliousand
birds
,
and
qnite
darkening
the
air
,
so
close
do
they
keep
together
,
even
when
flj'ing
.
Great
nnnibers
are
netted
in
some
parts
of
the
conntr}-
,
or
taken
by
bird-lime
,
or
shot
;
for
when
feeding
,
they
keep
close
to
each
other
.
On
one
occasion
,
on
the
cavalry
parade
groiind
,
at
Kamptee
,
I
bagged
twelve
dozen
birds
after
discharging
both
barrels
,
and
many
wonnded
birds
escaped
.
They
get
quite
fat
about
this
time
,
and
are
really
very
excellent
eating
,
and
they
are
alwa3'S
called
Ortolan
by
Europeans
in
India
.
They
leave
the
north
of
India
about
the
end
of
April
,
or
beginning
of
May
,
and
the}'
breed
in
the
steppes
of
Central
Asia
,
Eastern
Russia
,
and
also
in
Northern
Africa
,
placing
their
nest
on
the
ground
at
the
edge
of
a
scrub
or
bush
,
and
laying
four
to
six
eggs
,
usually
marked
with
grey
and
rufous
spots
,
but
sometimes
,
it
is
said
,
unspotted
yellow-↵brown
.
"
It
is
probable
that
,
as
with
all
the
Larks
,
insects
form
a
large
proportion
of
this
bird
's
food
in
summer
and
seed
in
winter
.
Herr
Gatke
says
(
"

Birds

pp

)
:
—
"
Formerly
,
hardly
a
year
passed
without
this
pretty
little
Lark
being
observed
here
at
the
end
of
May
or
June
,
even
though
only
in
ver}-
solitar}'
instances
.
In
former
years
,
when
more
favourable
conditions
of
weather
prevailed
,
the
bird
was
seen
pretty
frequently
in
autumn
,
sometimes
even
as
late
as
November
.
During
the
time
I
have
been
collecting
,
it
has
passed
through
my
hands
about
thirty
times
;
and
besides
that
,
it
has
been
seen
and
heard
,
without
being
killed
,
on
an
equal
number
of
occasions
.
I
kept
one
of
these
pretty
little
birds
over
a
year
in
a
cage
;
it
had
been
momeutaril}-
stunned
by
a
very
light
shot
which
had
grazed
the
back
of
its
head
,
but
recovered
ver\'
soon
,
and
became
extraordinarilj''
tame
.
It
underwent
a
complete
moult
in
the
autumn
,
managed
to
get
safely
through
the
winter
,
and
sang
heartily
during
the
spring
;
but
died
,
much
to
my
regret
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
.
Its
song
was
much
more
like
that
of
a
Bunting
than
a
Sk}-
-
Lark
.
I
fed
it
on
Canary-seed
,
which
,
like
a
Lapland
Bunting
in
a
cage
hanging
by
its
side
,
it
used
to
peel*
before
consuming
;
a
Shore-Lark
on
the
other
hand
,
which
I
had
had
for
over
ten
years
in
a
cage
,
never
did
this

it

and

.
To
Great
Britain
this
bird
was
at
one
time
only
an
irregular
visitor
,
but
since
the
winter
of
1869-70
when
there
was
a
considerable
immigration
to
our
eastern
coasts
,
its
appearance
in
autumn
and
winter
has
been
regular
;
according
to
Mr.
Aplin
,
specimens
have
visited
us
on
the
northward
migration
in
spring
as
late
as
April
22nd
.
On
the
eastern
coast
of
Scotland
it
has
been
met
with
as
far
north
as
St
Andrews
.
In
1906
a

visited
Fair
Isle
(
Shetlands
)
,
from
October
to
December
.
The
adult
male
of
the
Shore-Lark
has
the
forehead
,
a
stripe
partly
en-↵closing
the
eye
and
ear-coverts
,
and
extending

with

;
two

tail-feathers
coloured

those
of

the

the
outer
feather
with

;
remainder

breast
,
flanks
,
and
thighs
;
flanks
streaked
with
brown
;
bill
and
feet
black
;
iris
deep

.
The
female
is
smaller
,
duller
,
with
less
black
and
no
erectile
tufts
on
the
head
,
but
with
dark
centres
to
all
the
feathers
of
the
upper
parts
.
Young
males
resemble
the
winter
plumage
of
the
female
,
but
young
females
show
no
yellow
on
the
forehead
and
have
black
bases
to
the
feathers
of
the
crown
.
After
the
autumn
moult
adult
birds
have
yellow
margins
to
the
feathers
on
the
head
and
nape
.
In
summer
the
vShore
-Lark
inhabits
the
dry
sandy
plains
and
rocky
liills
nf
the
tundras
,
only
approaching
the
rivers
to
drink
.
Seebohm
says
that
it
seems
to
be
entirely'
a
ground
bird
,
and
he
never
saw
it
either
on
a
tree
or
a
Inish
.
Everyone
speaks
well
of
the
song
of
the
Shore-Lark
,
for
although
it
is
short
and
not
very
varied
it
is
full
of
melod3
^
It
is
sung
by
the
bird
not
only
when
on
the
earth
—
but
,
as
with
the
Sky-Lark
,
much
more
frequently
when
the
bird
is
soaring
in
the
air
.
At
such
times
it
is
said
to
atone
for
the
brevity
of
its
song
by
repeating
it
over
and
over
again
:
this
is
practically
what
.Uauda
arz'i-fis/s
does
if
3'OU
take
the
trouble
to
listen
to
him
attentively
.
The
call-note
is
described
as
loud
and
clear
.
As
is
the
case
with
all
our
Larks
,
this
species
forms
its
nest
in
a
slight
depression
in
the
earth
or
among
stones
;
sometimes
entirely
unprotected
,
but
at
other
times
under
the
shelter
of
rushes
.
The
nest
,
owing
to
the
country
where
it
is
constructed
,
naturally
differs
somewhat
in
its
materials
from
those
of
the
Larks
with
which
we
are
familiar
in
England
;
externally
it
is
similar
,
being
formed
of
dead
grasses
,
bents
,
etc
.
;
but
internally
it
is
lined
with
willow-down
and
reindeer
hair
.
The
eggs
number
from
four
to
five
,
rarely
three
(
the
latter
probably
not
representing
a
full
clutch
)
and
chiefly
differ
from
those
of
the
Sky-↵Lark
in
tlieir
generally
more
olive
tint
.
To
show
how
easily
this
apparently
conspicuous
species
may
be
overlooked
,
Mr.
Fenwick
Hole
,
in
the
"
Field
,
"
for
Nov.
19th
,
1864
,
recorded
the
fact
of
his
shooting
a
pair
,
of
which
he
only
secured
one
,
under
the
impression
that
they
were
common
Sky-Larks
.
He
says
"
I
was
only
led
to
shoot
at
them
at
all
from
a
desire
to
try
my
big
duck
gun
at
such
small
objects
on
the
ground
;
you
may
,
therefore
,
judge
of
my
surprise
,
when
picking
up
the
dead
specimen
,
at
my
double
stroke
of
good
luck
—
firstly
,
chancing
to
alight
on
such
a
rarity
;
and
secondly
,
firing
at
it
at
all
.
"
Speaking
of
three
speciniens
shot
out
of
a
flock
of
about
twenty
at
Lowestoft
,
in
February
,
1865
,
the
late
Henry
Stevenson
says
:
—
"
The
contents
of
their
crop
*
*
*
appeared
to
consist
of
seeds
of
Polygonacea
and
the
chrysalis
of
some
small
insect
.
"
The
food
of
this
Lark
consists
very
largely
of
seeds
,
although
in
the
summer
insects
,
their
larvae
,
and
pupae
,
as
well
(
doubtless
)
as
spiders
are
eaten
;
it
also
devours
small
mollusca
and
Crustacea
cast
up
on
the
sea-shore
.
Being
both
tame
,
beautiful
,
and
musical
,
the
Shore- Lark
is
often
caged
;
and
of
late
years
,
it
has
frequentl}^
been
exhibited
at
bird
shows
.
Herr
Gatke
observes
:
—
"
On
account
of
its
pleasing
appearance
I
have
kept
one
of
these
birds
for
years
in
a
cage
.
The
song
,
though
by
no
means
loud
,
is
nevertheless
agreeably
Lark-like
;
its
call-note
,
with
which
it
cheerfully
greets
me
as
soon
as
it
hears
my
step
,
two
large
rooms
off
,
is
loud
and
mellow
.
Most
of
the
birds
are
peevish
in
captivit}'
,
and
tire
themselves
by
impetuously
fluttering
against
and
shaking
the
bars
of
their
cage
;
this
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
of
one
's
not
being
able
to
avoid
selecting
the
prettily-marked
old
males
for
cage-↵birds
.
My
example
,
however
,
which
I
have
kept
now
for
more
than
ten
years
,
is
so
tame
that
it
will
take
flies
from
the
finger
,
and
even
allows
me
to
put
my
hand
into
the
cage
and
softly
stroke
its
back
with
my
finger
.
In
the
spring
this
bird
will
accept
so-called
earwigs
,
and
in
the
summer
flies
,
but
rejects
both
these
insects
as
autumn
approaches
.
Small
and
moderately
sized
moths
are
always
acceptable
,
and
spiders
are
received
with
the
utmost
readiness
at
all
times
of
the
j-ear
.
Its
staple
food
,
however
,
is
Canary-seed
,
and
as
much
green
food
as
is
procurable
.
Sustained
in
this
manner
,
the
bird
keeps
in
excellent
condition
,
renewing
its
plumage
every
autumn
to
such
perfection
that
it
is
in
no
way
inferior
to
a
bird
living
in
a
state
of
nature
.
"
This
is
a
point
which
I
have
always
insisted
upon
,
with
regard
to
the
treat-↵ment
of
Larks
—
To
keep
them
in
condition
the
grass
and
other
seed
which
they
freely
eat
when
wild
,
must
be
represented
by
Canar3^
-seed
:
they
will
eat
millet
,
but
they
undoubtedly
prefer
Canar}'
,
for
if
the
two
seeds
are
mixed
together
and
supplied
iu
one
pot
,
the
Canary
is
all
consumed
before
the
millet
is
touched
.
It
is
also
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
Lark
to
husk
ever}'
seed
before
swallowing
it
;
this
is
done
either
by
fixing
it
in
a
convenient
crevice
and
hammering
it
with
the
end
of
the
bill
,
or
by
giving
it
two
or
three
blows
in
the
feeding
trough
;
but
a
hungry
Lark
swallows
it
with
the
husk
on
,
and
probably
ejects
it
as
a
pellet
later
,
as
most
insectivorous
birds
do
.
When
one
considers
that
,
during
the
winter
.
Larks
would
be
simply
starved
to
death
if
their
lives
depended
upon
insects
;
and
consequently
that
they
then
subsist
almost
entirely
upon
seeds
of
weeds
or
grain
;
it
becomes
evident
that
—
to
feed
them
in
captivity
solely
on
soaked
ants
'
cocoons
,
yolk
of
egg
,
and
mealworms
,
is
in
the
highest
degree
unnatural
.
To
obtain
good
singers
of
any
of
the
Larks
you
may
either
hand-rear
them
,
purchase
them
when
recently
fledged
,
that
is
as
"
branchers
"
(
the
bird-catcher
's
term
for
young
Larks
)
or
catch
them
when
fully
adult
;
it
matters
very
little
,
only
hand-reared
birds
and
branchers
will
be
tamer
at
first
than
adults
(
although
even
these
become
perfectly
tame
in
a
few
months
)
and
,
in
addition
to
their
natural
song
,
will
pick
up
parts
of
the
songs
of
other
birds
.
Appendix
.
WHEN
I
was
asked
to
prepare
the
first
volume
of
this
work
for
the
press
,
I
was
already
busily
engaged
upon
the
preparation
of
two
other
books
,
one
of
which
was
published
about
a
fortnight
before
the
said
first
volume
appeared
,
the
other
being
still
in
hand
as
I
write
.
It
need
,
therefore
,
be
a
matter
of
no
surprise
to
my
readers
,
that
I
was
unable
,
for
lack
of
time
,
to
ferret
out
particulars
respecting
all
the
recent
accidental
visitors
to
our
shores
—
some
of
them
,
doubtless
,
man-assisted
immigrants
,
or
that
I
overlooked
some
extra
occurrences
of
visitors
alreadj'
recorded
in
British
Bird
books
.
Had
the
admirable
articles
by
the
late
Howard
Saunders
,
and
by
Messrs.
H.
F.
Witherby
and
N.
F.
Ticehurst
been
then
published
,
I
admit
that
it
would
have
been
better
to
inclttde
all
these
vagrants
(
as
has
been
done
in
the
present
volume
)
,
but
,
under
the
circumstances
,
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
devote
the
necessary
time
to
elaborate
this
subject
.
This
has
been
most
ably
accomplished
in
the
first
volume
of
that
excellent
magazine
—
"
British
Birds
,
"
by
the
above-mentioned
gentlemen
.
As
one
reviewer
of
my
first
volume
considered
me
very
remiss
in
not
bringing
the
list
of
chance
visitors
up-to-date
(
though
each
year
adds
to
the
list
)
,
I
propose
to
remedv
the
deficienc}'
here
as
far
as
possible
,
though
it
is
impossible
to
keep
pace
with
the
constantly
published
records
of
occurrences
.

THE

I
can
not

I
have
much
faith
in
the
distinctness
of
the

,
even
as
sub-↵species

from

the

The
Tree-Pipit
occurs
at
Fair
Isle
,
Shetlands
,
as
a
bird

autumn
passage
,
according

W.
E.
Clarke
;
it
has
been
observed
on
Scilly
in

1895
;
a
