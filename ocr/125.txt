Brandt's Siberian Bunting.

Eiiibciiza aoidcs, BraNDT.

AN example of tlie Chinese race of this species, said to have been obtained
near Flamborough, in October, 1887, was purchased in June, 1888, by Mr.
R. W. Chase, of Birmingham : there seems, however, to be some question
as to the date of capture ; * and, in any case, it appears to me to have no claim
to be called a British species.

The Rustic Bunting.

Eiiihcriza rusliid, PallAS.

AN accidental straggler to our shores, of which the first example was captured
near Brighton, on October 23rd, 1867, the second was shot on the Holder-
ness coast, Yorkshire, on September 17th, 1881, the third captured at
Elstree reservoir, near L'mdon, on November, 1882. A young male was shot at
Westfield, Sussex, by a boy in September 1902, a female was recognized at St.
Leonards in 1906; another, captured in Northumberland in 1902, was exhibited
at the Crystal Palace in 1905, two examples were secured in Scotland in 1905
and one in 1906. It is tolerably certain that nearly all the specimens of this
and the following species which are from time to time exhibited at bird-shows,
are Continental specimens.
