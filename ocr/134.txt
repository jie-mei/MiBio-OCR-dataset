in its gait and manner of looking np, with the neck stretched out, reminded me
of the actions of a quail. In the aviary of Air. J. H. Gurne}-, this bird assumed
its full summer plumage in the following spring, and thrived so well in its new
abode, that over-feeding was probabl}' the cause of its death in May, 1856, when
for the second time, it had acquired the black head and plumage of the breeding
season, and was certainl}' a perfect lump of fat when skinned for the purpose of
preservation." (Birds of Norfolk, Vol. I, p. 181).

The food of this species consists largely of insects in the summer and seeds
in the winter; but in confinement it should be treated like the other Buntings.
It is undoubtedly the most desirable of all the British Buntings for the aviculturist,
and should certainly be freely imported as a cage-bird.

The Snow-Bunting.

Plectroplunax niva/is, Lixx.*

ACIRCUAIPOLAR species, breeding chiefly in the Arctic regions beyond the
limit of forest growth ; or at high elevations further south, excepting in
the Faroe Islands and Shetlands where it places its nest little above the
sea-level. In winter it migrates southwards to Central Europe, South Russia,
Turkestan, North China, Japan, and north America as far south as Georgia. It
has been known to visit the Azores, Morocco, IMalta ; and is a rare, but regular,
winter visitor to Ital}'.

To Great Britain the Snow-Bunting is chiefly a winter visitor, generally
reaching the eastern coast of England in October, though rarely in September, and
commencing its return migration from March to April. Although rare in England
