who empties a charge of shot into the branches of his fruit-trees, can, therefore,
hardly expect them to be benefited thereb\'. If he were wise he would bait a
cage-trap, catch his Bullfinches and sell them at a shilling apiece for cage-birds :
the}' would, even then, die quite soon enough to satisfy any feelings of enmity
which he might nourish, for my experience of these birds in captivity is — that it

through the midst of them produces much the same result as the rush of a bull
through a crowded street. Yet this powerful looking bird is really most inoffensive ;
if annoyed he only opens his mouth aud makes grimaces, and if he does become
tame, he is not long in doing so: one which I had was tempted to take sunflower-
seeds from my fingers three weeks after its capture : a Canary, with which I
paired it, was far less afraid of it than our indigenous Finches were.

A FULL account of this species will be found in my book " Foreign Finches
in Captivity." I do not admit its claim to be called British, for although
five examples have been obtained in England, one at Brighton, in 1869,
and the other at Hampstead in the following year, it is quite possible that both
