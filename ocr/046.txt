occasiou I called upon them to try aud obtain a cock bird for breeding purposes;
and, seeing that they had paired a Greenfinch and hen Canary in one of their
cages, I asked whj- they were trying to breed such ugly unremuuerative mules.
They replied that their stock was getting weak, and they always introduced Green-
finch blood when their birds were falling off in vigour, aud then bred out the
taint, pairing the mules with Canaries. This has been supposed an impossibility;

been bred from hybrids, paired with either parent stock, have been exhibited at

and the Caucasus, and possibly to Northern Persia and Turkestan. On the
African Continent a few examples breed in Algeria, and the species has been
known to straggle as far northward as Egypt.

In Great Britain the Hawfinch is local, but according to the late Howard

localities in most of the counties of England and in Ireland. To Scotland it is
still chiefly an accidental winter visitant, though one nest was obtained in 1903
near Newport, in the east of Fifesliire.

Although the form of the Hawfinch is anything but graceful, its colouring is
