In colouring the Chough is shining black, glossed -with blue and purple; the
wings slightly greenish; the bill and feet are orange-vermilion; iris brown. The
female is a little smaller than the male. Young birds have the bill and feet dull
orange.

The haunts of the Chough are chiefl}' sea-side cliffs and rugged mountain
sides, and Dixon mentions that he observed a colon}' in Algeria "in a low ridge
of rocks, on the side of one of the barren stony valleys near the snow-capped
summit" of Djebel Mahmel. It is gregarious in its habits and appears to pair
for life. Its flight is somewhat characteristic ; consisting largely', as Howard
Saunders says, of "a series of curves in the air, alternatel}- rising with a scream,
and then suddenl}' dropping with almost closed wings"; its red bill is distinguish-
able at a considerable distance : on the earth it both walks and runs.

Seebohm renders the cry of the Chough as Khef-o, klia'-o; but Howard
Saunders says - "The usual cry is a clear metallic 'Kling,' but in autumn I have
heard flocks uttering 'chough-chough' very plainly." The food consists of insects
and their larvae, worms, probabl}' mollusca, berries and grain.

The nest is usually situated in some wholl}' inaccessible hole or cixvice, often
at some distance from the opening, in the face of an overhanging cliff or near
the roof of a cave ; but sometimes in old castles, church-towers, or disused lime-
kilns ; it is constructed of dry plant-stems, frecjuently of heather, and lined with
dead grass, rootlets, wool, and hair, or with some of these materials only. The
eggs, three to six in number, vary from dull creamy to greenish-white in ground-
colour, and are more or less boldly spotted and streaked with various shades of
brown and grey, some specimens having the markings pretty evenly distributed
over the entire surface, whilst others have them chiefly massed towards the larger
extremity.

Nidification generally' commences late in April or early in May.

Many local names have been given to this bird, amongst which those of
Cornish Crow and Red-legged Crow are somewhat freely used; one of the names
Hermit Crow is hardly applicable to a bird which lives and breeds in colonies.

Seebohm says that the " Chough, like the Rook, leaves its roosting-place early
in the morning, and repairs to the neighbouring pastures in search of food, some-
times even being seen to follow the plough to pick up worms and grubs. It is
always a restless and a wary bird, never remaining long in one spot, but shifting
its ground in short uncertain flights."

It may be questioned Avhether this species ever attains a great age in confine-
ment, but it is very difficult to form any definite opinion, because of the apparent
carelessness with which exhibitors note the ages of birds : thus a Chough for many
