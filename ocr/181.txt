entitled "Little Brothers of the Air."* The accuracv of this lady's observations
will be at once recognized by all who have carefully studied the habits of birds.
The authoress' plea for the Crow, at the end of that chapter of her book,
though true in a measure of our Rook, could not be used in defence of the
Carrion or Hooded Crows; she says: — "A Crow parent on a foraging ex-
pedition is a most unwelcome visitor to the farmer with young chickens, or the
bird-lover interested in the fate of nestlings. Yet when I saw the persecuted
creature in the character of provider for four hungiy and ever clamorous mouths,
to whose wants she is as alive as we are to the wants of our babies, I took a
new view of Crow depredations, and could not see why her children should not
have a chicken or a bird for breakfast, as well as ours. Poor hunted Crow,
against whom ever}' man's hand is raised ! She feels, with reason, that every
human being is a deadly enemy thirsting for her life, that every cylinder pointed
upwards is loaded with death, that every string is a cruel snare to entangle and
maim her — yet whose offspring, dear as ours to us, clamour for food. How-
should she know that it is wrong to eat chickens ; or that Robin babies were
made to live and grow up, and Crow babies to die of starvation ? The farmer
ignores the millions of insects she destroys, and shoots her for the one chicken
she takes, though she has been amply proved to be one of his most valuable
servants."

The note of the Rook is usually carr, but sometimes catv, and one of the
birds in a neighbour's rookery, born and reared during incessant rains, seemed to
have contracted a chronic cold, for his note was like that of a Golden Eagle, ar-cc-o.

The food in summer consists of grain, worms, snails, insects and their larvae,
and in dry-seasons or arid localities, of mice, fish, mollusca, young birds, eggs,
the maggots in carrion and possibly the flesh itself. Later in the year fruits,
beech-nuts, acorns, and berries ; but in winter, when all these are gone, it has
to get what it can from refuse heaps or from the scraps cast out from houses ;
though, when opportunity offers, it does not scruple to destroy sparrows and
other small birds.

The Rook is not suitable either for cage or aviary ; ni}- brother had one for
some time, but it was anything but an interesting pet. Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote
writes: — "The Rook is harmless; but, like the Carrion-Crow, very sluggish in
its movements ; scarcely ever uttering a sound. It is also very wild and never
attempts to talk, at least that is my experience." f
