The Swallow.

Ilinoido yu\tica, LiNN.

THE Swallow breeds throughout the greater part of Europe, Asia, north of
the great luountaiu rauges, and Northern Africa : in winter it has been
obtained all over India, to Burma and Malaysia, and throughout Africa :
exceptional cases of its occurrence in East Finmark, vSpitzbergeu, and Nova Zembla
have been recorded.

Throughout Great Britain the Swallow is generally distributed, although it is
said rarely to breed in Shetland, and never in the Outer Hebrides. According to
Capt. Feilden it is common in the Faroes, in Ma}^ but is not known to nest
there. At the season of migration the Swallow collects into flocks, and }ilr. Fro-
liawk, in September (about the 28th or 30th), counted 113 sitting on one stretch
of telegraph wire at Buckland, in South Devon.

In adult plumage this species has the forehead chestnut, upper parts prussian-
blue, wings and tail brown, with the outer webs of the feathers bluish-green ; the
inner web of the innermost greater wing-covert greyish- white ; all the tail-feathers
excepting the central pair, with white patches on the inner webs : under parts
almost white, the throat chestnut ; a belt of prussian-blue across the breast ; under
wing-coverts and belly huffish ; bill and feet black ; iris hazel. The female chiefly
differs from the male in the shorter tapering outer tail feathers, somewhat duller
colouring, whiter under parts, and narrower breast-belt. Young birds are duller,
with the chestnut portions paler, and the spots on the tail somewhat rufous.

It is believed that the Swallow pairs for life, and it is certain that it returns
year after year to the same breeding spot, sometimes even utilizing the previous
year's nest ; it is naturally a gregarious bird ; though perhaps not so much so as
the House- and Sand-Martins ; where one nest occurs, in chimney, barn, or out-
house, there are sure to be three or four close b}^ but I never observed more than
half a dozen or so, even in the largest barn, whereas it is not unusual to see eight
or ten nests of the House-Martin under the eaves of a house, whilst the occupied
burrows of Sand-Martins in a single sand-bank frequently number from twenty to
thirty.
