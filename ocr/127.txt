iu Siberia, Mongolia, uud China, and a snbspecies in Turkestan and Yarkand,
have been distinguished by names ; but none of them occur in Great Britain.

The Reed-Bunting is resident with us, and generally distributed throughout
our islands, although onh- a chance visitor to the Shetlands. In the autumn there
is an extensive immigration from the Continent, which reaches our eastern coasts
and the coasts of Ireland in September.

The adult male has the head, including the chin, throat, and centre of breast
jet black; a white moustachial streak running from the base of the lower mandible
to join a white collar continuous with a belt which bounds the black of throat
and breast; feathers of back, wing-coverts, and secondaries black, bordered broadly
with bright chestnut; lower back and upper tail-coverts bluish-ash, the feathers
tipped with chestnut, those of the lower back partly black-centered ; primaries
smok3'-brown, with narrow chestnut edges to the outer webs ; tail blackish, the
two outer feathers on each side with the greater part of the outer web and a large
wedge-shaped patch on the inner web white; remainder of under parts dull white,
tinged with bluish-ash and buff, and streaked with black on the flanks ; beak
brownish-black, under side of lower mandible much paler; feet brown; iris hazel.
After the autumn moult, the feathers of the head, back of ueck, chin, throat, and
front of breast, have tawny or brown tips, and the feathers of the lower breast
and belly are stained at the tips with buff. In the female the feathers of the
head are dark brown with reddish-brown borders ; the lores and a superciliar}^
stripe bounding the ear-coverts pale buff; the throat is white, bounded on each
side by a broad blackish streak ; the breast is streaked with brown ; otherwise
she is similar to the male, though slightly smaller. The young bird is very like
the female.

During the summer the Reed-Bunting is essentially a marsh-loving bird,
frequenting all moist spots in the neighbourhood of rivers, broads, canals,
drains, or streams, wherever rushes, reeds, and the wiry grasses which delight in
damp soil abound; in such spots its nest is almost sure to be found by careful
searching.

At this season the Black-bonnet is always paired, but as autumn approaches
it wanders over the country in small flocks, often associating with Corn Buntings,
Larks, Pipits, or Wagtails, and wandering through stubbles and rick-yards in
search of scattered grain, or waste corners where weeds abound, the ripened seed
of which afford them food.

But the summer time affords the most satisfactory opportunites for watching
the habits of the Reed-Bunting, and Norfolk is one of the best counties in which
to study it. As Stevenson observes: â€” "the broads in this count}- must be looked
