The nesl itself is built after the pattern of that of the Bullfinch, a foundation of
twigs of Scotch fir, enclosing a cup-shaped structure of dr\- grass and lichen;
the lining being formed of somewhat finer materials, mixed with moss, wool, or
feathers.

The eggs number fri)m four to five, but rarely- exceed four ; the}' var_v in
colouring from greenish-blue to gre_vish-white, and are spotted, speckled, and
sometimes almost streaked with dai-k-brown ; there are also underlj-ing spots of
pale reddish-brown, and the larger end is occasionally dusted with greyish. The
specimen figured on our plate is from the collection of A. B. Farn, Esc|.

Whilst feeding their 3'oung the Crossbill feeds largel}' upon caterpillars, and
other larvae, also the chrysalides of a little moth, as well as buds of trees; but
later, as the fir- and pine-cones ripen, it extracts the seeds with its powerful man-
dibles and feasts upon them. Berries of various kinds are largely eaten, and
Seebohm says that the Crossbill is very fund of apples, but this is not strictly
correct, for it simply tears the fruit to pieces and drops it, eating onl}' the pips ;
I frequently observed the destructive act in the case of a pair of caged Crossbills
once in nn' possession, but my birds never ate the pips.

Lord Lilford (Birds of Northamptonshire, Vol. I, pp. 205-6) observes: â€” "We
have geuerall_v found the Crossbills ver\- tame and easy of approach, and a flock
of these birds, bnsil}' emploj-ed in feeding on the seeds of a snow-laden fir-tree,
is a beautiful and most interesting sight. Their actions in quest of food very
much resemble those of the suuiller Parrots as they cling to and clamber about
the large cones, from which they extract the seeds with wonderful rapidity. In
confinement we have found this species, though it soon becomes perfectly tame,
invariably very restless, and constantly climbing over all parts of its cage as if
seeking to escape. As above mentioned, fir-seeds are the natural and favourite
food ; but these birds will readily feed on hemp-seed, and almost any of our
common berries." "Although we have found our tame birds ver}' fond of the
pips of apples, we never could induce them to extract the said pips from the fruit
for themselves."*

My own experience of the Crossbill as a cage-bird agrees very closely with
the above as regards its disposition and behaviour : the following are mj' notes on
this species: In the winter of 1886-7, my friend Mr. J. Johnston gave me a pair
of Crossbills, and within a week the cock-bird would take sunflower seeds from
my fingers. These birds are quiet but amusing creatures, much like Parrots in
their actions. I placed their seed in one of the ordinary tin hoppers to prevent
their wasting it, but in two days they had found out how to lift up the lid at
