wlien caterpillars and aphides, but especially the latter, are abundant, the Sparrow
makes itself somewhat useful in the countr_v, although it must be admitted that
he drives away many more strictly insectivorous birds who could do the same
work far more efficiently.

On the other hand both to the gardener and farmer the Sparrow is a positive
scourge, completely ruining beds of young carnations, or borders of crocuses and
primroses, breaking tender shoots in its ponderous struggles to secure insects,
scattering earth right and left over freshly gravelled paths in its search for newly
sown flower-seeds ; sampling peas, fruit, and grain of all kinds in abundance.
Moreover, even the insects which it devours when feeding its young, onl}' represent
a portion of their diet ; whole i^ows of young beans and lettuce are devoured and
partly digested by the parents for the same purpose : it must also be borne in
mind that even the holding capacity of the ever huugr}' Sparrow is limited, and
that it feeds its young from the crop for some days after they leave the nest (as
anyone may see, who watches the birds in his garden, or in the thoroughfares of
cities and villages) so that there is by no means that incessant destruction of
noxious insects during the rearing of a Sparrow's progeu}', which renders the
Titmice such enormous benefactors to the fruit-grower.*

The 3-oung town-bred Sparrow, instead of being nourished on clean partl}^
digested grain, young vegetables, and insects, has to put up with all kinds of
refuse and garbage, and when it leaves the nest and is almost able to peck for
itself, I have sometimes been amused to see its mother satisfy its cry for food
by scooping up a beakful of mud out of a half-dried puddle and emptying it into its
gaping mouth : it is not surprising that we sometimes see city-bred birds with ruffled
plumage and dull eyes, almost too ill to get out of the way of approaching vehicles.

The nest of the House-Sparrow is placed in any suitable hole or crevice
either in buildings, trees, or banks, on projecting bricks amongst ivy growing
over walls, on beams in barns against a wall or upright support, in nests of House-
and Sand-Martins ; but in nearly all such situations its nest is not characteristic,
being either extremely untidy and almost shapeless, or formed like that of most
Finches in cup-fashion, though with somewhat less regular walls The more
typical nest is built in the branches of trees, hedges, and (according to Dixon)
in furze-bushes ; it is a very bulk}' bag- shaped structure, the entrance being either
close to, or at the top, so that the light falls more or less directl}' into the cavit}' :
this form of nest is also usually built on beams in barns, and I once found a
