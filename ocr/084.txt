same time, I gave her two of the Twites' eggs, making up the number for each
with infertile eggs ; both birds hatched on the same day ; the two in the Redpoll's
nest perished at once, though she is a good feeder, and has reared two broods of
her own this season ; the Twite successfully reared hers, and they left the nest
un July iQtIi, and arc now very fine birds, but quite normally coloured; this I
expected, as I have reared a large number during the past few years from both
white, pied, and cinnamon Lesser Redpolls, and have inbred them, but have never
liad one vary in the least from the normal colour.* Young Twites are not nearly
so precocious as Redpolls ; the}' were a long time before thej' attempted to peck
for themselves, and even now (August) clamour to the old ones for food, whereas
I have seen j-oung Redpolls a week after leaving the nest shell hard Canary-seed.
My birds have no soft food given them, but as much of the flowering top of the
dwarf-grass, dandelion, and hard-head tops, thistle, plantain, etc., as the}- wish, and
as many aphides off rose, apple, or plum-trees as I can at the time obtain ; infested
branches being put in the aviary for the birds to peck them off. The latter, I
consider, are very essential for the successful rearing of Finches in confinement,
especially for the first few days after they are hatched."!
