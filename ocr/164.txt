sets off to fly to sonic point, chang-es his mind, swings graccfnllv ronnd and
alights on the exact spot from wliich he started ; indeed he is very fond of
aerial evolntions ; his wings are rapidly flapped when on the wing, and when he
alights on the ground he generally comes down with either a see-sawing or spiral
motion. On the gronnd he is almost as fussy as a Starling in his search for
worms or leather-jackets of which I have seen him carry many to his nest from
my garden : undoubtedl}- he does fulfil his duties in the scheme of nature.

The cries of this bird have been varioush' described as cae. caiv, (jiiick, jack,
cvc, but the only notes which I have licard uttered by wild Jackdaws have been
cliack and cli,u-k, from which sounds, without question, its name has been derived:
its note is utterly unlike that of the Rook or au}' of the other British Crows.

The Jackdaw as a rule is gregarious in its habits ; although in the suburbs,
a pair will sometimes take possession (jf a chimne3% in which they will build
alone ; consorting, however, when feeding, with the Rooks which inhabit some
avenue of elms in the neighbourhood : but, whenever possible, this species breeds
in colonies, the nest being almost invariably placed in some crevice or hole in
rock, building, tree,* or even a rabbit-burrow ; ivy-clad ruins and belfries of old
churches being favourite sites.

Nidification commences in April t)r May, frequently not until the latter month,
and the nest varies considerably in bulk according to the site in which it is con-
structed ; it is always carelessly formed and generally of the veriest rubbish ;
wool and moss are often used, but th(jse which I have Rmnd in belfries consisted
mere!}' of sticks and a little dirty straw, with a fe\v feathers ; whilst one in my
collection taken from the winding staircase leading up to the belfry of old ]\Iiltou
Church, near Sittingbourne, on 25th May, 1887, consists of a great mass of hair
(either the winter-coat of horses, or refuse from a barber's) with a little loose earth,
a dead leaf or two, and a little dirty straw : the depression for the eggs is very
shallow.

The eggs number from four to six and vary a good deal, but the commonest
type is pale blue, more or less boldly spotted with sepia, and with lavender-grey
shell-spots ; sometimes the spots are absent, and I have seen a few eggs in which
the markings were small, numerous, and pale, almost resembling eggs of the Alagpie.

The Jackdaw pairs for life : it rears only one brood in a season. Its food
consists in summer chiefly of worms, all kinds of ininrious grubs, especially those
of the crane-fly, the cockchafer, the wireworm, also insects, mollusca, and (it must
alas be admitted) eggs and j^oiing of other birds, grain, peas and earh' fruits :
