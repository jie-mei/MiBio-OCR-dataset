OI"" tlie distribiuiou uf this species Howard vSauiiders says; - "To the Faroes
the Brambliug is only an exceptional visitor. On tlie niainhmd it breeds
throughont the sub-Arctic pine and birch forests, from Norway to the
valle}' of the Amur : wliile on migration it occurs in Japan, China, Northern
India, Asia Minor, and the whole of Europe ; but it is only in very severe winters
that it pushes its wanderings to the African side of the Alediterraueau. Immense
flocks sometimes visit Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Heligoland ; but state-
ments that this species has nested in the P3'renees, the Alps, or the Ardennes,
are as yet unconfirmed." (Manual of British Birds, p. 177).

To Great Britain the Brambling is chiefly a winter migrant, although there
is reason for believing that a few pairs have occasionally remained to breed with
us. Although pretty generalh' distributed throughout our islands in winter, it
appears to be rather more numerous in Scotland than in England, whilst in
Cornwall, the west of England, and the south of Ireland, it is rarer than else-
where; and in very severe winters it is more abundant, but particularly near
beech-woods.

The adult male in breeding phnnage has the upper parts blue-black, some of
the feathers with tawny margins, the middle of the lower back and rump white ;
scapulars and lesser wing-coverts bright tawny ; median coverts white ; greater
coverts black, tipped with white, so as to form a prominent bar ; quills smoky
black ; the primaries with narrow yellowish white margins, the inner ones with
white bases ; secondaries with white margins towards their extremities ; upper
tail-coverts black, with ashy tips ; tail black, the outer feathers with a little white
at the base of the inner web, and about half the outer web broadly white ; sides
of head black ; throat and breast reddish-tawny ; belly white, the flanks spotted
with black, and the thighs black behind ; under tail-coverts white, tawny on the
vent ; beak blue-black ; feet reddish-brown ; iris hazel. After the autumn moult
the feathers of the head and back have broad tawny margins, as also have the
tips of the greater wing-coverts and the innermost secondaries ; the quills and
