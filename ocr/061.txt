may have escaped from some ship passing our shores, or (soon after importation)
from an aviary.*

This bird, sometimes called " Scarlet Grosbeak," is, superficially, in no respect
like a Bullfinch ; whereas in notes, form of beak, outline of body, and behaviour,
it approaches the Serins. After its first moult in captivity the male loses all its
rosy colouring, just as the Crossbill does.

The Serin.

Serinus horlulanus, KoCH.

DR. SHARPE gives the geographical distribution of this species as : -
" Central and Southern Europe, ranging eastwards to Asia Minor, Palestine,
and Egypt : and northwards to Northern Germany, Denmark, and occasion-
ally the British Islands."

Although there is no absolute proof that the few specimens of this species
which have been obtained in Great Britain may not all have escaped from con-
finement, the Serin being a well-known and tolerably freely imported cage-bird ;
the fact that it breeds in the Netherlands, renders it quite possible, and even
probable, that they ma}' have been stragglers to our coasts. Seebohm observes : -
"It is said that a Serin was caught near Portsmouth, in April, 1852, another at
Taunton, in 1866, and a third at Worthing, in 1869; but by far the greater
number are those brought by the Brighton bird-catchers to Mr. Swaj'sland. Rarely
