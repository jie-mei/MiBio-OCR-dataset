uote -wliicli the late Mr. Witcliell renders tell, must be that which souuds to me
like c/iov.1.

This species is of no interest as a cage-bird, unless hand-reared : a caught
Sparrow rarel}^ lives long, is always wild, vicious, voracious, and unmusical ; if
haud-reared it has been known to learn and sing the sougs of the Goldfinch,
Linnet, Canary, and Skylark. A friend of mine had one which imitated the
Canary's song perfectly, but seemed ashamed of its performance, for it always
turned its face to the wall and sang quite softly ; it also never sang until the
evening when the Canaries had gone to sleep. For feeding caged Sparrows I
should recommend sunflower-seed, oats, Canar}', and German-rape ; groundsel- and
plantain-heads ; with a few insects and their larvae.

Albinism seems to be on the increase in this species, and more particularly
in Loudon ; where, if one examines each flock that one passes in a half-hour's
walk through the streets, it is not at all unusual to see several pied varieties :
there are always two or three among those which collect for crumbs in front of
the Natural History Museum.

Passer nioiitanus, LiNN.

SEEBOHM gives the distribution of this bird as follows: - "The Tree-Sparrow

circle. It appears to be very rare in North Africa, and to be absent altogether
from Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine, Central and Southern Persia, Baluchistan,
and India south of the Himalayas ; it is, however, abundant in Turkestan,
