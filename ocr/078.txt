The female is slightly smaller than the male, with a broader crown ; upper parts
slightl}- darker; rump and breast without rose-red colouration; the under parts
also somewhat more streaked than in the uuile. The ^-oung ncarl_v resemble the
female, but have no red on the crown. After the autumn moult the rose-colouring
disappears, but towards the spring it gradually reappears iu the feathers without
a moult : this reproduction of bright colouring does not, however, take place in
caged Redpolls, but, where the}' are confined in large well-ventilated sunny aviaries,
it does iu the first season.

In its habits, haunts, food, and song, the Lesser Redpoll nearly resembles
the Meal}' type : its nest, which is placed in the fork of a tree, a hawthorn, or
gooseberry bush, a hedge, or a large grass tussock, usually near water, is not
unlike a small, neatl}' formed, and very softly lined Linnet's nest ; it is firmly
constructed of plant-stalks, roots, moss, and drj'-grass, with hair towards the
interior ; the lining consisting of pure white willow-down, wool or occasionally
very fine grasses and feathers. The eggs, which number from four to six, are
either pale blue, or bluish-white, with dark purplish-brown surface spots, and
sometimes short linear dashes and underlying blood-red spots and speckles ; some
eggs are spotted nearly' all over, and others principally at the larger end, an
imperfect zone of spots is often present at this extremity : there is considerable
variation iu size.

I have not only seen and heard the Lesser Redpoll in Kent during the breeding
season, but have on several occasions flushed the hen bird from her nest ; twice
I obtained the nest with six eggs from grass-tussocks growing upon narrow foot-
paths through marsh and pools of water, at Alurston,* and once from a hawthorn
bush on marshy land, at Kemsley ; the last-mentioned nest was less firm than
usual, though compact, the body of it being formed almost entireh' of wool, with
an outer thin framework of dried grass and an inner lining of hair.f

Lord Lilford (Birds of Northamptonshire, Vol. L P- 196) observes: â€” "About
Lilford these birds appear occasionally in flocks of from Iwenty to fifty or sixty,
almost always in very severe weather, and then haunt the alders by the river-sides,
their habits and manner of feeding at that season much resembling those of the
