after I had taken the first chitch : these eggs are more heavily marked than any
which I have obtained elsewhere.

The Swallow is an admirable singer, and I shall not easily forget the pleasure
with which I first heard it, as it poured forth its sweet melod}' from the girders
of a large railway-station in Switzerland, in 1869 ; I have heard it several times
since, both in Kent and Norfolk, singing from a telegraph wire : the song is ver}'
varied and, to my mind, far more melodious than that of a Linnet. Its call may
be heard as it chases its insect prey - hvi/, hivit, or as it greets a passing comrade,
lnvit-(it-tit-(il.

The food of the Swallow consists largel}' of gnats, small flies, and ephemerae ;
but it frequently settles on the roads, or on manure heaps, to search for small
dung-beetles : owing to its short legs, its progression on the earth is somewhat
awkward, and when hurried it uses its wings to help it along : it usually drinks
on the wing, skimming the surface of the water as it glides over : its rapid graceful
flight is too well known to need description, sometimes at such au elevation that
the eye can scarcely follow it, sometimes so near the earth that the grasses wave
under the rush of its out.spread wings.

As a cage-bird the Swallow is a mistake ; he sits upon his perch all day
looking miserable, rarely moving excepting to eat or drink : specimens have been
exhibited at the Crystal Palace shows, held in 1889, 1890, 1891, 1893, and 1896:
in one case the bird was awarded a prize, although it only had one perfect wing ;
as a rule the staple food placed in the cage for the consumption of these unhappy
captives consisted of gentles.

So far as I can judge, the object of the owners of caged Swallows is, not to
make their pets happy, but to rush them from one show to another, in the hope
of gaining many awards before their prisoner dies ; one of the unfortunates was
described as "Winner of 23 First, and 11 Special Prizes" - Poor Swallow!

At the London Zoological Gardens the Swallow has been kept in a large
aviar}-, where it seemed to be perfectly happy.
