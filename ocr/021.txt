The nests of the Flycatchers are open, and more or less cup-shaped in
character ; they are frequently placed in holes or crevices in trees, rocks, or walls ;
but some of the species build upon thick branches, or even in the forks of branches ;
the eggs of the different species vary considerably in character, some being heavily
spotted, and others spotless.*

The flight is undulating ; the song low-pitched, and not of great merit ; the
food consists mainly of insects, but is supplemented occasionally by a little fruit.

Formerly the limits of this group of birds were much more extended than at
present ; Jerdon even included the Blue-throats, and expressed it as his opinion
that the Tyrants of the New World belonged to the family : vSeebohm observed
that - "The Flycatchers inhabit the Palaearctic, Oriental, and Ethiopian regions,
extending southwards to the Moluccas, but not occurring in the Australian region.
Four species are found in Europe, of which two breed in the British Islands, and
one is an accidental visitor." The latter, at the time when his "British Birds"
appeared, had only occurred here three times, but of late years other examples
have been obtained.

HOWARD SAUNDERS states that this species "breeds as far north as
Tromso, in Norway, and Archangel, in Russia ; while southward it is
tolerably abundant throughout Europe, nesting down to the northern shores
of the Mediterranean ; also on the African side, and in Asia IMinor, Palestine,
