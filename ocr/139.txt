and always remain nervous in a cage ; the species of the genus Ictcyus, however,
are marvellously tame birds. In one respect, in addition to their general outline,
the true Starlings resemble the so-called "Meadow-Starlings"; they are very
gregarious.

In their nidification the Stuiiiidcc as a rule differ both from the Icki tdcc and
Coivida; building their nests of all kinds of rubbish, in holes or crevices of
trees, banks, rocks, walls, or buildings : their eggs are uniform in colouring and
usually greenish-blue ; but both in the Stuniidcc and Icicrida there are exceptions
to this broad distinction.

No birds are so easy to capture as Starlings, nets and traps awaken no suspicion
of danger in their unreflecting brains ; they see food, and rush in helter-skelter
to secure it ; so that a small trap will sometimes secure from three to five at
one fall.

Sfitniiis vulgaris, LiNN.

GENERALLY distributed over the greater part of Europe, breeding as far
to the south as Northern Ital}'. The European birds which migrate, pass
the winter in the south of France, Portugal, Spain, Ital}', Greece, Northern
Africa and Palestine. The Asiatic birds breed in Southern Siberia, Persia,
Turkestan, and eastward to the Amur : they winter in India, passing through
Mongolia on migration.

In Great Britain the Starling is partially resident and generall}- distributed
throughout Great Britain and Ireland ; in the latter island it used to be rather
local in the breeding-season, but it now nests in every county ; in Cornwall and
