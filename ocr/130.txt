The food consists chiefly of insects, their larvse, and small mollusca in snmmer,
but of seeds in winter : in confinement, however, very little insect food is necessary
to keep this bird in health. In October, 1888, I purchased my first male Reed-
Bunting from a catcher. I turned it into my largest covered aviary, where it
lived a perfectly inoffensive, though stupid and absolutely silent life until 1891 ;
the winter following the death of this bird my man caught a second (in company
with Skylarks) which also lived about three years, dying before its spring change
of plumage, whilst a third example was given to me and died more quickly. Not
one of these three birds ever uttered the slightest sound, nor have others which
I have owned more recentl3^ and although fairly tame they all showed a skulking
disposition, rarely appearing in the open part of the aviary excepting to feed, and
showing none of that somewhat sprightly activity which characterizes this species
in its wild state. As an aviary bird, I can, therefore, only recommend this
Bunting on account of its quiet beauty of plumage and absolute innocence.

Iceland - to which it is only an occasional straggler from Greenland - and

is only at considerable elevations, such as the Dovre Fjeld, in Norway, that it is
found breeding to the south of the Arctic circle ; but east of the North Cape it
is common in Lapland, while in Northern Siberia it is extremely abundant, being,
