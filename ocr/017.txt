FAMILY AMPELID.55.

FORMERLY this constituted a fairly large group, including even such distinct
looking birds as the members of the genus Lioi/irix, birds moreover which,
in their habits nearly resemble our Accentors : I believe, however, that the
relationship of the Liothrix to Accentor is now recognized. Jerdon even included
the Tits, as well as the White-eyes and Accentors, in the same family.

Seebohm, who only admitted one family for the Passercs, necessarily regarded
the present group as a Subfamily " consisting of birds having the wing of a
Starling, the foot of a Shrike, and a bill intermediate between that of a Shrike
and a Swallow. They are probably most nearly allied to the Shrikes and the
Starlings : from the former they may at once be distinguished by the minuteness
of their bastard primary, their short tarsus, and their nearly obsolete rictal bristles.
Ornithologists are perhaps justified in placing them in a distinct Subfamil}^ in
consequence of the shortness of their tarsus, their shorter, wider, and notched beak,
and the presence of small bristles which cover the nostrils." (Hist. British Birds,
Vol. n, p. i).

Although the species of Ainpelis have somewhat the flight of a Starling, they
build open nests in the branches of trees ; and, in their actions, somewhat resemble
Tits. In all probability they are more nearly related to the Shrikes than to any
other group of British birds ; but they are not predaceous like that murderous
family, being insectivorous and frugivorous, and they appear to have little idea of
song.

Of late years Waxwings have been somewhat largely kept as cage birds ; but,
in spite of their beaut}-, they are anj'thing but pleasing pets, their lack of vocal
merit, and their greediness, which results in a perpetual dirty condition of their
cages, are great drawbacks.
