and primaries. Hitherto I have kept the birds together in the hope that the
Buzzard might recover his lost courage, but I have now arranged to separate
them, as I am afraid of the Buzzard being permanently injured." The remainder
of Mr. Comyns' notes are more in accordance with general experience, and there-
fore, of less interest.

Mr. Frohawk saw seven examples of this species at tlie mouth of the Avon
(S. Devon) at the end of September, 1895 ; they all kept together and may
perhaps have been the old and young of the same family.

The Carrion-Crow.

Corviis iOfoiic, Linn.

IN Siberia, according to Seebohm, this species occupies the forest country
Ijdng between Yenesay and the Pacific coast, extending northwards in
summer almost to the limits of forest growth and south-eastwards to Japan.
Westwards he is of opinion that, following the mountain-ranges of southern
Siberia into Turkestan, it crossed the Caspian, passed through an equally large
colony of Hooded Crows by way of the Caucasus, the northern shores of the
Black Sea and the valley of the Danube and keeping to the north of the Alps
spread over Germany, the Netherlands, the British Isles, France and Spain. He
was able also to prove that this species interbreeds with the Hooded Crow in the
valleys of the Elbe and Yenesay (as it is known to do in Scotland) producing
many intergrades between the two species, examples of which he presented to
the Trustees of the British Museum ; these have been carefully mounted, and
form one of the most instructive and attractive cases in the entrance-hall of the
Natural Histor}' branch of that Museum at South Kensington.
