clever!}- imitated the gutteral uute of the Missel-Thrush. Unless they are required
for training, it is better to catch than to rear Starlings, selecting brightly coloured
males, close-feathered, with long snake-like neck and head, and generally slender
bod}' : these are really the best birds, although they rarely win at shows unless
kept warm and forced before their time into summer plumage. Most judges of
British birds ignore torm, being simply attracted by bright colouring.

Pastor loseus, LiNN.

OF the geographical distribution of this bird, Seebohm says: â€” "It breeds
more or less regularly in Asia Minor and on the western shores of the
Black Sea. The most westerly recorded instance of its breeding in large
numbers is in Lombardy. At Villafranca, near Verona, in 1875, great numbers
bred in the castle, having followed in the wake of a flight of locusts. They have
not been known to breed in Palestine ; but Tristram describes enormous numbers
passing through on their spring migration. Eastwards they breed in South Russia
and the Caucasus, Turkestan, and South Siberia, as far east as Lake Saisan.
They have been observed in North-west Persia and Afghanistan in spring. They
winter in India in enormous numbers, and are occasionally found as far south as
Ceylon. The most easterly locality recorded of this bird is the Andaman Islands,
where flocks were seen by Col. Tytler, in January ("Ibis," 1867, p, 331). At
this season of the }ear, and on the spring and autumn migrations, they have
occurred in almost every country of Europe, from Spain in the west to Sweden
in the north, and have been known to stray as far south as North Africa, one or
two examples having been recorded from Egypt and Algeria."
