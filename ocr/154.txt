about the possession of a nut, for tlie cock often tried to rob his mate, and she
made ever}' endeavour to retain her tit-bit, squeaking in a low key. It was on
the 19th of February that I first saw the male Nutcracker feeding his mate: she
fluttered her wings all the time, and cried as a young bird might have done.
Thereafter the relations of these birds became most intimate. I tried mv best io
induce them to nest in the aviar^', but they could not make up their minds to
breed in confinement.

Unfortunately, my health broke down completely in the spring of 1893; I
was obliged to leave my birds to the care of a friend. When I returned to duty
in the following September I found my birds newly dead, to ni}' great regret.
The female had died from moulting troubles. It was thought that her faithful
mate had died of grief, as he pined awaj^ from the day of her decease.

The late Lord Lilford informed me in 1893, that he had kept a number of
Nutcrackers in confinement. He said that his birds were specially fond of hazel-
nuts and walnuts. They were supplied also with 'ever}' other variety of nut and
berries that could be procured- hips, haws, peas, beans, acorns, blackberries,
beech-mast, cones of spruce, boiled rice, stale bread-crumbs, hard-boiled egg, now
and then a little boiled liver, beetles, earthworms and crushed hemp-seed. The
latter was mixed with dried ants' eggs.' I must say that ni}- birds declined to
eat anything except nuts ; but I was away on sick-leave during the months in
which their diet would naturally have varied most.

The late Mr. John Hancock kept a specimen of the Nutcracker in confinement
for six years. ' Its voice was very peculiar. It had an extremel}' harsh, loud
cry, resembling the noise produced by a ripping saw while in full action. This
cry was so loud that it could be heard all over the house. It had also a sweet,
low, delicate, warbling song. This was only uttered when everything was quiet.'

I never heard my male sing. He crozved, with a loud guttural caw, which
was uttered while the bird perched in a drawn, upright position, the mandibles
being visibly extended. He had a low squeaking note of pleasure, and could
address his mate in curious terms of endearment."
