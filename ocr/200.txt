In summer the vShore-Lark inhabits the dry sandy plains and rocky liills nf
the tundras, only approaching the rivers to drink. Seebohm says that it seems to
be entirely' a ground bird, and he never saw it either on a tree or a Inish.

Everyone speaks well of the song of the Shore-Lark, for although it is short
and not very varied it is full of melod3^ It is sung by the bird not only when
on the earth — but, as with the Sky-Lark, much more frequently when the bird is
soaring in the air. At such times it is said to atone for the brevity of its song
by repeating it over and over again : this is practically what .Uauda arz'i-fis/s does
if 3'OU take the trouble to listen to him attentively. The call-note is described
as loud and clear.

As is the case with all our Larks, this species forms its nest in a slight
depression in the earth or among stones ; sometimes entirely unprotected, but at
other times under the shelter of rushes. The nest, owing to the country where
it is constructed, naturally differs somewhat in its materials from those of the
Larks with which we are familiar in England ; externally it is similar, being
formed of dead grasses, bents, etc. ; but internally it is lined with willow-down
and reindeer hair. The eggs number from four to five, rarely three (the latter
probably not representing a full clutch) and chiefly differ from those of the Sky-
Lark in tlieir generally more olive tint.

To show how easily this apparently conspicuous species may be overlooked,
Mr. Fenwick Hole, in the " Field," for Nov. 19th, 1864, recorded the fact of his
shooting a pair, of which he only secured one, under the impression that they
were common Sky-Larks. He says "I was only led to shoot at them at all from
a desire to try my big duck gun at such small objects on the ground ; you may,
therefore, judge of my surprise, when picking up the dead specimen, at my double
stroke of good luck — firstly, chancing to alight on such a rarity ; and secondly,
firing at it at all."

Speaking of three speciniens shot out of a flock of about twenty at Lowestoft,
in February, 1865, the late Henry Stevenson says: — "The contents of their crop
* * * appeared to consist of seeds of Polygonacea and the chrysalis of some
small insect."

The food of this Lark consists very largely of seeds, although in the summer
insects, their larvae, and pupae, as well (doubtless) as spiders are eaten ; it also
devours small mollusca and Crustacea cast up on the sea-shore.

Being both tame, beautiful, and musical, the Shore- Lark is often caged ; and
of late years, it has frequentl}^ been exhibited at bird shows.

Herr Gatke observes : — " On account of its pleasing appearance I have kept
one of these birds for years in a cage. The song, though by no means loud, is
