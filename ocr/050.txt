Lo\ia bifasctala, C. L. Brkhm.

HOWARD SAUNDERS gives the following account of the distribution of
this species, aud its claims to be regarded as British seem to be well
supported :- It " inhabits the coniferous forests of Northern Russia, and
Siberia, as far as the Pacific ; wandering in autumn aud winter to South Sweden,
Denmark, Heligoland, North Germany, Holland, Belgium, the North of France,
North Italy, Austria and Poland. In our Islands the first recorded specimen was
obtained near Belfast, Ireland, on May nth, 1802, and in July or August, 1868,
a second was obtained in co. Dublin. A few years prior to 1843, one was killed
in Cornwall; in the autumn of 1845, a flock appeared in the ueighbourhood of
Brampton, in Cumberland, and ten or eleven were shot, six of them being in
female plumage; in May, 1846, two or three were killed from a flock near Bury
St. Edmund's, Suffolk ; and about the same time the late H. Doubleda}' shot a
bird in his garden at Eppiug. Others have been observed in various parts of
the United Kingdom." (Manual of British Birds, p. 195.) A male was obtained
at Westfield, Sussex, iu 1899, aud a female at Woodchurch, Kent, in 1902.

The adult male has the feathers of the upper surface of a rose-madder tint,
browner on the back, and inclining to carmine on the rump, the bases of the
feathers broadly black ; the wings are black, the greater aud median coverts being
broadly tipped with white ; the inner secondaries edged with white at their
extremities ; tail brownish-black, with rosy-white edges to the feathers ; under
surface rose-madder, whitish on the bell}', becoming quite white towards the vent;
beak and feet horn-brown ; iris hazel. The female above is greenish-grey, washed
with yellow, and streaked with brown ; the rump is yellow ; under parts sordid
yellow, streaked with brown ; the throat and abdomen paler. The j'oung bird is
distinctly greyer than the female, more prominently streaked, with narrower tips
to the median coverts; the flights and tail-feathers with well-defined greenish-
white margins.

The American form of this species (known as the "White-winged Crossbill")
has, on several occasions, been obtained upon our shores ; but, considering the
