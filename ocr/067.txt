every tone and movement is fnll of auimation and delight, as if it were beside
itself witli pleasnre ; this is particularl}' the case in the nesting season, at which
time I have seen the male flying slowly towards some topmost spray of a fir-tree,
ponring forth his delightful little warbling song, which very much resembles that
of a Goldfinch, but is to my ears far sweeter. It vcr}- often sings when flying,
but more frequently when perching on some fir-tree top ; indeed the Siskin in
spring seems more like a visitor from a happier world."

The Siskin usually places its nest high up, near the end of a lateral branch
of a fir- or Ijirch-tree, or even at the top against the main stem ; but the nest is
also said to be sometimes built quite low down in spruce, furze, or juniper bushes,
though Seebohm was inclined to doubt the correctness of the records iipon wdiich
this statement is based, Naumann having asserted tliat tl;c nest is always in con-
ifers, seldom less than twenty-five feet from the ground. The nest itself is neatly
constructed of moss and rootlets, upon a slight foundation of heather and bents,
and the lining consists of vegetable down, horsel]airs, and sometimes a few feathers.
The eggs number from five to six, and exactly resemble those of the Goldfinch
in size, colour, markings, and variations: they are bluish-green, usuallj' pale;
spotted, dotted, and sometimes streaked with dark chocolate-brown, and with lilacine
gre3dsh shell-markings ; as with the eggs of all the typical Finches, they vary
considerably in size.*

Like all the true Finches the hen bird builds the first nest and incubates
alone, although the male as usual tries to help and only succeeds in hindering ;
whether he works in earnest at the second nest I do not know : but, from his
close relationship to the Goldfinch, he should be capable of doing so.

The Siskin feeds largely on seeds of weeds and beech-mast ; but during the
breeding season it eats a considerable number of aphides, and probably small green
caterpillars, milky, unripe seeds of groundsel, sow-thistle, and similar weeds ; whilst
at all seasons, it is as mischievous as a Tit in destroying tender buds. In captivit}'
it eats the usual seeds, being especially fond of hemp and teasel, also soft food,
green food, and (although I do not approve of such food) it is as fond as the
Goldfinch and the whole of the Tits of picking a bone, clinging to it in all
positions, and behaving in every respect exactly like a Tit. The Siskin is one
of the most charming of all aviary birds, on account of its wonderfull}' confiding
nature. I turned a pair which I purchased in November, 1889, about three weeks
after their capture, into a large aviar}' ; and, in three daj-s, they had so thoroughl}-
learned to trust me, that they flew into my hand and disputed over poppy-seed
