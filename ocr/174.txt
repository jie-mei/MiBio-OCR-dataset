of all kinds are devoured greedil}', as well as insects, their larvae, and grain. In
the winter lie is more limited and has to content himself with grain, berries, and
such weakly half-starved birds or beasts as he can manage to kill.

Mr. O. V. Aplin ("Zoologist," 1883, p. 409) published the following note on
the food of this species : - " An old disused bridle-gate .standing near one corner
of Clattercutt Reservoir has this season served as a feeding spot for a pair of
Carrion-Crows, which reared their young in a tall elm on one side of the pool.
One evening in June, after the grass was cut, I found strewn around it the
remains of several toads and frogs, and of one partly fledged nestling finch, also
a number of broken shells of the eggs of the Wild Duck and Partridge. The
state the gate was in showed that it was a much frequented perch, and a tell-tale
wing-feather would have named the robber even if he had not hurriedly left an
adjacent tree at my approach, and with loud croaks expressed his displeasure at
my intrusion on his banqueting hall. I have always tried to defend this fine
bird, and was sorry to find such ample proof of its destructive habits. Only a
few days ago (October 1883) I counted thirty-two Crows in a stubble-field close
to this village, and considering their abundance in this district, it is only a
wonder that any game or wildfowl can rear their j'oung at all."

Although inclined to a solitary life during the breeding-season* the Carrion-
Crow is seen in larger or smaller crowds during the autumn and winter : con-
siderable numbers arrive on our eastern coasts in autumn.

Seebohm's statement that this bird "makes almost as engaging a pet as the
Raven" hardly accords with Lord Lilford's opinion of the Carrion-Crow. The
following is Mr. Bonhote's experience, communicated November and, 1896: -
" The Hooded and Carrion-Crows are to be strictly avoided ; the latter bird
when hand-reared is very tame and can articulate a few words, but has no
interesting actions or habits and scarcely moves the whole day. The former bird
(Grey Crow) is not only stupid, but dangerous, and is never satisfied till he has
the whole aviary to himself, having murdered the other inmates."
