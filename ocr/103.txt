tail-feathers have fairly broad yellow luargius ; the feathers of the sides of the
ueck have ashy edges ; the sides and flanks are washed with orange-tawny, the
black spots ou the flanks are less prominent, and the beak becomes bright ochre-
yellow, with brown tip.

The female somewhat resembles the male in winter plnmage bnt is altogether
dnller, the black of the npper parts being replaced by brown, and the bars on the
wings are mnch less prominent. The yonng at first are very like the female,
bnt the males qnickly develop their characteristic colonriug.

The breeding plnmage of the male is acquired without a moult, and it is said
that the change is effected by shedding the tips of the feathers.

Although somewhat less active than the Chafflnch, this species is quite as
quarrelsome in the breeding season (at any rate in confinement) ; in winter, how-
ever, the flocks which travel about through woods and over fields in search of
food agree perfectly with one another and with Chaffinches. Speaking of them as
observed near Sheffield, Seebohm observes: - "They are remarkable noisy birds, and
sit upon the tree-tops twittering to each other until dusk ; they sometimes fly up
into the air in a compact mass, and after wheeling round several times again alight.
They roost in the yew and holly trees, and a fair proportion of them seek quarters
in the ivy."

The site chosen by the Brambliug for its nest is usually at a height of from
fifteen to twenty feet from the ground in a birch or fir-tree, at the junction of a
branch with the trunk; the nest has, however, been found in juniper bushes. In
his "Catalogue of Birds of the Dyke Road Museum, at Brighton," j). 126, the late
Mr. E. T. Booth says: - "In the summer of 1866, while fishing on the river Lyon,
in Perthshire, I had occasion to climb a beech-tree to release the line which had
become entangled in the branches, and while so engaged a female Brambling was
disturbed from her nest, containing three eggs, which was placed close to the stem
of the tree. As I was anxious to procure the young I left her, and ou visiting
the spot in about a fortnight the nest was empty, and, judging by its appearance,
I should be of opinion that the young birds had been dragged out by a cat. This
is the only instance I have ever known of the Brambling attempting to rear its
young in Great Britain."

In the "Field" for July 23rd, 1864, p. 52, the Rev. J. C. Atkinson recorded
the fact of a nest with five or six eggs having been taken at Baldersby Park, near
Thirsk, Yorks., by the Hon. Guy Dawnay.

The nest is larger and more coarsely made than that of the Chaffinch, beiug
formed of white and buff birch-bark, moss, lichens, and spiders' web, and lined
with fine grass and feathers. The eggs, five to seven, usually six, in number, are
