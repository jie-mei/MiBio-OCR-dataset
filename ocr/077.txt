The LEvSser Redpoll.

.■{ciDilhis ra/csci-ns, ViElLLOT.

OCCURS iu Western Europe, aud probably breeds iu some of the mountains
of the South-West ; one nest having been obtained from the Veglio Alps,
in Italy, about 7,000 feet above the sea-level.
Iu Great Britain this Redpoll is resident, breeding most freely in the north
of England and Ireland, aud iu well-timbered localities in Scotland, more particu-
larly iu plantations of birch. This bird is, however, by no meaus restricted to
the north of England, or Ireland, during the breeding-season ; its nest having
been found in most of the southern counties to the east of Somerset, in the north
of which county it has also bred : in Kent, I believe, it breeds regularly, though
not abundantl}', every j-ear.*

The upper surface, of the adult male in breeding-plumage is ruddy olive-
brown, longitudinally streaked on each feather with blackish ; wings and tail
darker brown, with pale margins ; innermost secondaries broadly margined; median
and greater coverts with broad huffish tips; crown bright satiny crimson iu front;
rump washed with rosy-red ; lores and centre of throat black ; sides of head and
throat golden olive-brown ; breast rose-red ; sides and flanks golden olive-brown,
streaked with blackish ; belly white, stained with huffish ; beak ochreous-yellow,
