Fieldeu (P.Z.S., 1877, p. ,30) iu a paper on the birds of the North PoLar Basiu,
says: - "Ou the 13th May, 1876, I heard the first Suow-Buuting- fPlectropliauis
nivalis) as we lay in onr tent on the floe at the base of a cliff. The note came
from above, clear and musical, and each inmate of the tent started into a sitting
postnre, and said 'Hnsh, hnsh, do yon hear it?' One of the sailors said to me,
' What bird is that sir ? it is sweeter than a throstle.

IMy friend Mr. David Seth-Smith had a pair for a considerable time and may
perhaps still have them ; I have seen them flying about iu one of his garden
aviaries many times, but never heard the song.

FAMILY vSTURNID^.

THE Starlings are an Old World family of birds linked to the Finches through
the hicridcr or Troupials and Cow-birds of the New World; but, ou the other
hand, showing affinity to the Corvida or Crow-family. They are character-
ized by a long straight slender bill, with the nostrils placed low down, without
rictal bristles ; a very small bastard primary aud very loug second primary ; the
tarsus is scaled in front, but uot behind.

Starlings wlieu on the ground progress in a purposeless, irregular fashion,
mostly by walking or running ; on the wing their flight is powerful, but peculiar,
so that, wheu at a great height, it has a twinkling appearance ; when at a lower
elevation this is explained by the fact that they rapidly flap their somewhat long
wings aud then sail straight forwards.

These birds are practically omnivorous, always hungr}' and consequentl}- large
feeders ; they are, therefore, unsuitable for caged pets, unless considerable attention
can be paid to them by their owners : in themselves, however, they are cleanly,
being exceedingly fond of bathing.

The songs of Starlings are either altogether, or partly, harsh iu character ;
iu which respect aud in their powers of mimicry, they somewhat resemble their
allies the Crows. Like the latter also they soon become tame and confiding iu
captivity ; in which respect they widely differ from some of the Ictcridcc which
never seem to get the least bit tamer after j^ears of confinement iu an aviary,
