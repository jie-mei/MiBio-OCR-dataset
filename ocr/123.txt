About 1891 a pair of Ortolan Buntings was given to me by Mr. P.J. Lowrey ;
and, judging (from my experience of Yellow Hammers and Reed Buntings in
captivit}') that this species would be equall}' inoffensive, I turned them out into a
large covered aviary with English Finches, and many small Ploceine Finches. At
first the Ortolans were quiet enough, their feathers being somewhat abraded (owing
to the fact that they had been kept in a cage in some small bird-shop) : no sooner
however, had these birds moulted and thus recovered their full power of flight,
than they occupied themselves for the greater part of each day in chasing the
unfortunate Waxbills and lylannikius all over the aviar}'. Apparently, the Ortolans
had no vicious intentions in the pursuit of their weaker associates ; they never
actually pecked them, when thev had an opportunity of doing so ; but the}' could
not resist the pleasure which the frantic terror of the little Finches evidently gave
them : the}' darted up and down the aviary almost with the rapidity of a Swallow,
whilst the poor little hunted birds, unable to escape by mere speed, were forced
to fling themselves against the wirework and double back to avoid their pursuers.

Seeing that it was impossible to keep Ortolans in an aviary containing
Ornamental Finches, I now captured my birds and placed them iu another aviary
with Redwings, Greenfinches, Chaffinches, &c., here they suddenly dropped all the
active habits which had previously characterized them, becoming as dull and
listless as other members of their genus : their health, nevertheless, was always
perfect, and their plumage tight and glossy. I parted with this pair at the same
time as I sold my Redwings, and subsequently they were made use of for show-
purposes.

In the late autumn of 1894 I selected a male Ortolan from a consignment of
Weavers (out of colour) which had just been received from Africa : it had been
imported, together with Abyssinian and Russ' Weavers, and with these I kept it
in one of my cool aviaries.

Like its predecessors, this Ortolan, associated as it was with naturally quarrel-
some and powerful birds, was singularly quiet and retiring in its demeanour ; indeed
it often seemed to weary of the constant wranglings and strong language of the
Weavers, and perched quite low down, or even on the earth ; where, from time to
time, it uttered its melancholy little monotonous song : although it never had a
chance of securing any insect food, all of which was greedily devoured as soon as
it was thrown into the aviary by three specimens of a Cape Weaver SiVcrora fS.
capensis ? ) it appeared to find all that it needed for its health in the few dried ants'
cocoons remaining in a saucer of soft food, which had already been picked over
