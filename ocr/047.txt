rather pleasing : - The adult male has the head of a ciunamon-brown colour, a line
round the base of the bill, the lores, chin, and throat, black ; the nape is smoky
gre}- ; the back and scapulars dull chestnut, somewhat paler on the rump, and
becoming rather j-ellower on the upper tail-coverts ; wings bluish-black, the median
coverts white ; the quills with a white patch near the middle of their inner webs,
gradually increasing on the inner feathers, and tipped with blue ; the tail-coverts
cinnamon-brown, much elongated ; tail feathers black, white at the extremit}' of
the inner webs : under surface of body pale Dove-brown, fading to white on the
under tail-coverts ; beak in summer bluish-grey, darker at the tip ; in winter
brownish ilesh-coloured ; feet flesh-coloured ; iris whitish. The female is duller
in colour, with the white markings less pure. The 3'Oung are without black on
the throat, or grey on the nape ; the head is also yellower, and the under surface
of the body whiter ; the mantle is mottled, and the breast and flanks are barred
with dark brown.

The Hawfinch is resident with us ; but it is probable that at least some of
the young leave our shores at the approach of winter, their places being taken by
immigrants from the north : in the autumn they not infrequently fly into the
nets of the birdcatchers, and are disposed of at ver}? moderate prices. During the
summer months the Hawfinch is an exceedingly shy bird, and is far more frequently
heard than seen ; its call-note, consisting of a whistle four times repeated, and
drawn out at the finish, being familiar to most frequenters of its haunts ; the
harsh Greenfinch-like sound, sometimes mistaken for its call-note, is probably its
cr}' of defiance. The song is a ver}' inferior performance of short duration, some-
what like that of an inferior Greenfinch.

The Hawfinch frequents well-wooded localities, such as forest-clearings, small
woods, plantations, shrubberies, heavily timbered parks, where patches of 3'ews or
hawthorn and bramble are left to break the monotony of the landscape, and old
orchards ; in such places it builds, varying the site of the nest according to the
haunt which it frequents ; thus in a wood or clearing it usuall}^ makes its home
in some old hawthorn, tangled with blackberry-vines, or in a holl}', or on the
branch of a fir, oak, or beech-tree, some fifteen to thirty feet from the ground ;
but in an orchard, an old lichen-covered apple or pear-tree is chosen.

The nest of this bird most nearly resembles that of a Biillfinch, being very
shallow, and alwa3-s formed in a foundation of twigs ; one which I found in
course of formation, had the whole of this external structure formed of strongly
spined interlaced twigs of hawthorn, from which all the leaves had been stripped,
and presented a most formidable appearance ; sometimes, however, the twigs are
intermixed with coarse roots and dead plants, and ornamented with lichens ; the
