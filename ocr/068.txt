and egg ; one of these birds lived fox- three years, and would even permit me to
raise my hand until my nose touched her beak, when she would fl}' off to a twig,
aud return directl}' I held my hand out to her again ; there were two hens and
a cock in this trio, and the male outlived both of his wives ; finall}- he appeared
to have acquired a growth in his throat, which obstructed his breathing; there-
fore as my experience of doctoring birds is, that in nineteen out of twenty cases
it kills them within ten minutes, I thought I would give my Siskin the oppor-
tunity of doctoring himself; so I turned him loose in my garden, where he
remained for about an hour, and then flew straight awa_v. I have had man^-
other Siskins at various times, sometimes three or four pairs together ; they
have alwaj'S become very tame in a snrprisingh' short period, and have been
altogether delightful pets ; but most of them have died within a few months.
Siskins do not seem to have anything like the constitution of most Goldfinches.
One tame little hen bird, however, lived to a good age ; and, when she had lost
three husbands in succession, I caged her and made a regular pet of her. After
six months I wearied of the extra labour (every separate cage adding to the time
occupied in providing for m}' large family) ; I, therefore, turned Cissie, as I called
her, into one of my bird-room aviaries ; but she had forgotten all about libert}^
flew wildly against the wires in the greatest terror, and presentl}' settled down in
a corner with her face to the wall ; having evidently decided thas life was no
longer worth having : I, therefore, picked her up and restored her to her cage,
where she sat looking stupid for half-an-hour before she recovered. I subsequently
gave this bird to a 3'oung lady, who christened her Priscilla, and made much of
her to the day of her death about a year later.
