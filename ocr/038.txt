general pet : his cage was kept in a small spare room, tlie wire door being usualljr
left open, so that he conld go out and in at pleasure ; every day, as soon as I
returned from town, I used to run up and call him, and he would at once fly to

shut and he had got into his snuggery, but I called out, " Well little chap, how
are you 'i " In a moment his head was popped out and he sprang to the cage-
door : I opened it, stepped back to the end of the room and called him, and he
immediately flew across as usual.

I don't think I was ever more fond of any pet than I was of that House-
Martin, and I felt his death acutel}' : but, nevertheless, I do not recommend the
species as a cage-bird ; its wings are so long, and its legs so short, that the
primaries constantly get dragged through the dirt and need frequently cleansing,
which tends to give the birds cold. A long and well-warmed corridor would make
a suitable aviary for them.*

northern districts of Africa, and abundantly in Egypt and Palestine. Eastward,
