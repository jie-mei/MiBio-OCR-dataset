at which several Sparrows and Chaffinches were already busy. I had this bird in
full view for some minutes, as he hopped about and regaled himself, till he was
attacked by a Sparrow, and flew up to the tree from whence he had come." *

The song of the Cirl Bunting differs from that of the Yellow Hammer chiefly
in the absence of the terminal double note ; it has, therefore, been compared with
that of the Lesser Redpoll and Lesser Whitethroat. The call-note of the young
and adult are said by the late Mr. Witchell to be " not unlike the call-squeak of
the Tree Pipit"; according to Seebohm the adult call-note "sounds like a
monotonous and plaintive chea-c/icy

Subsequent to taking niv first nest of the Cirl Bunting in 1^77, I frequenlh^
heard and occasionally saw the cock-bird in the same neighbourhood, but I did
not obtain a nest again till 1884, when I found two at Tunstall, the first on the
24th and the second on the 30th of AIa\' : four years later I obtained permission
to nest in some private grounds near Frinstead, in Kent, and on the 26th May I
took m}- fourth and last nest of this species.

The Cirl Bunting appears to be double-brooded, the first nest being usually
built some time in Ma}-, and the second in July. The sites chosen for the nest
are ver}- similar to those selected by the Yellow Bunting : according to Howard
Saunders who found it not uncommon on the chalk-hills of Surrey, it "is placed
in a bank among the stems of a hazel or other bush, though sometimes in furze,
or juniper, at a little distance from the ground." My nests were all found within
a foot or two above the earth, the first in a stunted furze-bush tangled with a
blackberry vine, two others in low juniper scrub overrun with bramble, and the
fourth in a young hawthorn bush.

The nest is tolerably compact internally, though externally somewhat loosely
put together, the outer wall usually consisting of coarse dead grass, bents, and
vegetable fibre ; the lining of fine fibre and black horse-hair ; occasionally a little
moss is said to be used in the lining ; but this material is rarel}- used by any of
the British Buntings. The eggs number from four to five (my nests contained
respectively foiir, four, three, and two eggs) and are often somewhat broader than
those of the Yellow Hammer, they are white, generally very faintly tinged with
lilac ; streaked, spotted, and dotted with purplish-black, especially towards the
larger end ; with small, and frequently indistinct lilacine-greyish shell-spots. The
markings often terminate in round blots ; and, occasionall}', some of the streaks
are chocolate. Seebohm describes an abnormal nest in his collection as "somewhat
looselj' put together, and made externally of various plant-stems, blades of grass,
