continual noises of a great city do not seem to disturb them at all, as is evident
from the fact that Rooks still build and breed in the old trees which have been
left standing in the busiest parts of London.*

The nest is usually connucuced or repaired early iu March, but after
unusualh- mild winters building operations sometimes commence much earlier.
After the exceptionally open winter of 1895-6 I saw several young Rooks sitting
just outside the nests in which the}- had been hatched as early as the 6th March,
whilst I had noticed the Rooks in a rookery close to my house repairing their
nests in January, and in Februar}- a pair daily visited m^' garden for worms : a
friend of mine living at Dulwich first directed my attention to the early pre-
parations for nesting made by these birds, assuring me in January that he had
seen a pair of Rooks carrying sticks up to their nest. In the "Feathered World"
for April 24th, 1896, Mr. W. N. Rushen says: â€” "I saw two young Rooks near
Wanstead Park, on April 8th, which were as strong on the wing as their parents;
and, to be as forward as this, the}- must have left the nest for some weeks." t

The structure is usually very compact, formed of strong sticks and twigs,
plastered with mud, lined with turf, straw, roots, and sometimes moss, dead
leaves, and feathers. The eggs number from three to five and vary considerably
both in form and colouring, exhibiting similar forms to those of the Carrion-
Crow ; they are, however, noticeably smaller. The ground-colour varies from
pale -blue to green, and is lighter or darker iu different nests ; the spotting is
olive-brown, fine and sparse, or coarser and thicklj' distributed over the entire
surface and sometimes with a few larger deep brown blotches or streaks.

Of the eggs figured on our plate, figs. 241 and 242 are from my own
collection, and 243 and 244 from that of Mr. A. B. Farn's.

When the young first leave the nest they are awkward and weak on their
legs, sitting huddled on a branch with their heads well down between their
shoulders ; as the wind sways the branch the}- tip forwards, and have to open
their short wings to recover their balance ; but, after daily short excursions
from branch to branch, the}' gradually gather strength and confidence, until
finally they are able to accompany their parents to the fields and get their
first lesson in finding food for themselves.

To those who have not noticed the methods by which the various species
of Crows are taught by their parents, I cannot do better than recommend the
admirable account given by Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller in her fascinating book
