The Lesser Grey Shrike.

Lioiiits )iii>iof, Gjiel.

THIS is so rare a straggler, on migration, to tlie English coast, that I hesitated
to describe it in the present work. In 1883, Seebohm mentioned that
onl}^ four examples had been recorded; and, at the end of i88g, Howard
Saunders only enumerated six: it has since occurred at Dorking in 1886; near
Bournemouth in 1900; at Docking (Norfolk), in 1902; near Chichester in 1905;
near Whitby in 1906, and in Bedfordshire in 1907 : it is therefore, perhaps a pity
that a plate of it was not produced ; still if everj^ straggler to our coasts was
depicted it would add greatly to the expense of this work.

The Red-Backed Shrike.

Lanius coUurio, LiNN.

SEEBOHM observes that this species " is a summer visitor to the whole of the
continent of Europe up to lat. 64°, with the exception of the Spanish pen-
insula, where it is only an occasional straggler to the north-east. In Greece,
Asia Minor, and Palestine, it is only found in the pine-regions. Eastwards its
breeding range extends through Northern Persia, and throughout Turkestan as
far as the Altai Mountains. It passes through Asia Minor and North-east Africa
