strongest nestlings always fight their way to the front, so that the weaker birds
are unable to get sufficient food to sustain life and quickly die.

In 1888 I successfully reared two nests of Linnets (nine birds) feeding them
at first on egg-food ; and, as they grew stronger, upon scalded German rape ;
unfortunately the whole of them died after their moult from inflammation of the
bowels. Since then I have been contented to return to my original plan and
purchase my Linnets from the bird-catchers.

The Linnet occasionally hybridizes in a wild state with the Greenfinch (Vide
Stevenson, Birds of Norfolk, p. 220; Seebohm, British Birds, Vol. IL p. 77; Howard
Saunders, Manual Brit. Birds, p. 162; Gurne3^ Zoologist, p. 3388; Rev. H. A.
Macpherson, Zoologist, 1887, p. 303, etc., etc.) ; and in captivity it has been
successfully crossed with several species, including the Canary ; this last-mentioned
bastard is not at all difficult to produce, for nu- first attempt resulted in three
mules ; but to breed hybrid Linnet-Canaries good enough to carrj' off" prizes at
our shows requires judgment and experience. The rarest and most valued
examples are those known as clear mules, in which the colouring of the Canary
is combined with Linnet characteristics . theoreticall}' these should be most readily
produced, when both parents have been inbred for several generations ; albinism,
or the absence of dark colouring, being a frequent result of inbreeding.
