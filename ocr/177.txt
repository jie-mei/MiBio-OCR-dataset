important ; as showing how little the agency of man can affect the extinction of
species, so far as it is directed merely against birds, their nests and eggs : -
"Finally, I would add one further remark, as regards the position of these Crows
in the econom_v of nature. Evcr\'where the protection of birds creates the greatest
interest, and man is always put in the foreground as the greatest enemy of the
feathered creation. Now, altliough the destruction of song-birds and other snuiU
species, as it appears to be carried on in Italy, ought to be resisted by all possible
means ; nevertheless all that is offered for sale, in the way of eggs and small
birds, in Ital}' during one complete migration period, would scarcel}' equal the
quantity of eggs and nestlings destroyed b}- the Hooded Crows during one single
summer day.

"It is perhaps true that the number of individuals of Hooded Crows becomes
nowhere apparent in such prepondering quantity as in Heligoland, in consequence
of which their destructive influence is under-estimated ; but if one had the oppor-
tunity of seeing the hosts of them which travel past during two months of
autumn, in uninterrupted sequence, and return in the spring, as is the case here,
where no tree, wood, or hill, impedes the view ; and if one at the same time
remembers that all these fellows, impudent as thej^ are cunning, do nothing else
during the long summer da3's, from earl}^ dawn to sunset, but plunder the nests
of other birds, from the Lark to the Eagle (Dresser), one would indeed wonder
that there are still any birds, other than Hooded Crows, left in the world. By
all means let us nurture and protect our little bird-friends in every possible
manner, more especially bj^ abstaining from destroying an}- small shrubbery or
bush, the sole use of which may, perhaps, be that it affords some small songster
a hidden nook for its nest; above everything, however, let us aim at compassing
the destruction of Hooded Crows unsparingl}', 3'ear in year out, b}' all the means
placed at our command."

The nidification of this species is similar to that of the Carrion-Crow; in
Ireland it commences about the middle of March, but in Scotland later; the nest
does not differ from that of C. coroue, and is similarly situated, although it has
been found built on the roofs of huts, according to Gray. The eggs are precisel}^
like those of the Carrion-Crow in all their varieties.

The cries of this species and of C. coronc are indistinguishable, and the food
is the same ; but the Hooded Crow is bolder and even more destructive.

Dixon is the only Ornithologist who seems to have a good word to saj- for
this Crow; he says: - "I must confess that, in spite of the dark tales of plunder
and his questionable mode of getting a livelihood, the Hooded Crow is a favourite
bird of mine, and his habits and regular movements never fail to interest me."
