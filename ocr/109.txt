forming its staple diet, varied in the summer by a few mealworms or cockroaches;
when wild it is said to eat grasshoppers; it also eats a little fruit. A caged
example is chiefly interesting for the show-bench ; consequently the unfortunate
specimen captured in Fifeshire seems to have had a busy life at the hands of his
owners. In an aviar}- this species would doubtless l)e more interesting, but it
would want watching at first, unless associated with birds as powerful as itself;
for some of the buntings are daugerousl}- sportive towards smaller and weaker birds.

IT would be useless to attempt to improve upon Seebohm's account of the
distribution of this species: - "Beyond the British Islands its range extends
throughout Central and Southern Europe. It is only found in the extreme
south of Norwa}' and Sweden ; and east of the Baltic its northern limit appears
to be Riea. It it doubtful if it has ever occurred as far north as Moscow or the
Ural Mountains ; but it is very locally distributed in Southern Russia, where it
is a partial migrant. It is a resident in the Caucasus and Western Turkestan,
and there is an example in the museum at Omsk, said to have been obtained in
the neighbourhood. It is a resident in the Canaries and North-western Africa ;
but in Egypt and Arabia Petrsea it is only found during winter, whence it probably
migrates to Central Europe to breed. It is a resident in Palestine, Asia Minor,
and North Persia, as far south as Shiraz." (Hist. Brit. Birds, Vol. II, pp. 148-9).

In Great Britain the Corn-Bunting is very local in its distribution, being
most abundant in well-cultivated grain-producing districts. In the south of England
it perhaps deserves its name of "Common Bunting," though it is by no means so
abundant as the Yellow Hammer, but northward it is rarer and far more local ; in
