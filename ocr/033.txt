The favourite haunts of the Swallow are country villages, hamlets, or even
isolated houses, and cottages ; but it rarely penetrates far into the larger towns.
It places its nest in various situations- - on joists of barns, out-houses, boat-houses,
in which case the form of the nest varies from an oval to a half-, or quarter-cup ;
against perpendicular walls under eaves of barns * ; inside chimne3's, wells, and
mines ; in corners of pillared porticoes to large houses ; under rustic bridges ; cases
have even been recorded of nests built in a hole in a tree about thirty feet from
the ground, and in the forking branch of a s3'camore. In its wild state in
mountainous or rocky localities this bird naturally builds against the sides of cliffs
under overhanging ledges of rock, or in caves ; but in Great Britain it usually
seeks the habitations of men for nesting-sites.

The nest is always open above ; the walls thick, and formed of mud-pellets
mixed with straw, ha}', or hair ; the lining consists of fine grass-stems, usually
almost concealed b}' a quantity of feathers, though in some instances these are
absent.

As is usually the case with nests more or less exposed to light from above,
the eggs are not wholly white and immaculate, the ground-colour is pure white,
appearing rosy when not incubated ; speckled, spotted, and occasionally heavily
blotched with deep pitchy brown, often intermixed with sienna reddish spots, and
with lavender-grey shell-spots ; in some eggs the spots are small and tolerably
evenly distributed over the entire surface, sometimes they are larger, and principally
collected at the larger end ; sometimes there is an imperfect zone of spots, and
even large blotches near the larger end : some eggs are elongated ovals, others
short and well-formed.

The Swallow when approaching its nest always utters a plaintive warning
note, the intention of which doubtless is, to call the attention of its 3'oung to its
advent ; but this call is uttered even before the eggs are deposited, and is continued
after the nest has been robbed : this has given the impression to unobservant
persons that the parents mourn over the loss of their possessions.

Seebohm asserts that the Swallow builds a fresh nest every j^ear ; but I have
proved conclusively that, when built under the shelter of a portico, where it is
protected from wet, the same nest is sometimes used for three consecutive years ;
indeed I have in my collection a nest with the clutches of eggs which it contained
in June 1881 and 1883 : in 1882 I was forbidden to touch the eggs because the
lady of the house said "the poor birds cried every time they approached the nest"t
