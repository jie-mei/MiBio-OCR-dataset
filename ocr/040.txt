neatl}' arranged, each feather lying on its face with tlie cnrvcd under snrface
upwards, and tlie base of the shaft in the centre of the nest : when carefully-
removed from the burrows, nests of this character are very prett}- ; the pinky-white
eggs appearing to lie in a pure white flower-like cup ; unhappih' a ver}' slight
puff of wind disturbs their symmetry, whilst the removal of the eggs inevitably
displaces the lining, so that one never sees a really perfect Sand-]\Iartin's nest in
any collection. One reason for the slovenliness of man}' cabinet nests probably
nia_v be, that where nests are abundant, the collector is satisfied with those most
readily attainable, and thus fails to secure the best-formed specimens.

The eggs vary in number from four to six, and in form from a long to a
short oval ; in colour they are pure white, very slightl}- gloss}-, and when freshly
laid show the yolk through the shell, which gives them a ros}- aj^pearance.

The burrows of Sand-Martins, although an irresistible attraction to the birds'-
nester, are often a source of considerable anno3auce to railway companies ; ever}-
year fresh tunnels are added, as those first formed extend too far inwards to please
the birds, one tunnel runs into another, is abandoned, and a new one excavated :
thus the bank of the cutting becomes so much undermined, that frosts and thaws
bring about a land-slip, and a temporar}' block to traffic is occasioned.

Of all nests which I have taken, I know of none which so swams with fleas
and ticks as that of the Sand- Martin ; the young birds if taken out and examined,
will frequentl}' be found to have large ticks attached to their heads, usually either
on the crown or nape ; whilst, in old colonies, the fleas skip about in myriads :
how the poor birds exist under the incessant irritation of these lively vermin is a
puzzle ; but perhaps, like the African attacked by cliigos, they enjoy the sensation.

The call-note of this bird is thin and shrill - a sort of szvter : the only attempt
at a song which I have heard is a short low twittering, somewhat vaguel}' resembling
part of the song of the Reed-Warbler, and usuall}' uttered when two birds meet
in the air and flutter a moment before continuing their onward flight.

Like the other Swallows, this bird is pureh^ insectivorous ; its food principally
consisting of gnats and small flics, which adhere to its viscid saliva, as with wide-
open gape it pursues them in the air : it has been stated to feed its 3'oung occa-
sionally with large dragon-flies, but this seems rather improbable, the bodies of
these insects being so long, that (if given entire) they could not be swallowed b}'
such tiny birds : the only chance is, that the greed of these nestlings which, when
fed, frequently try to swallow one another's heads, might possibly enable them to
tear the body of the dragon-fly in half. The Sand-Martin usually produces two
broods in the year, the first nest being rarel}- full before the beginning of June,
and the second about the middle of July, or even later : the return migration
