Some authorities consider the Shrikes to be uearlj^ related to the Crows ; in-
deed Seebohni made them a Subfamily close to tlie Corvi)ia, although he admitted
that their "exact affinities are very difficult to determine"; he considered that they
approached the Crows in the form of their bills, the strong bristles, and short
feathers partly covering the nostrils, and in their feet. Howard Saunders, from
the position which he assigns to them in liis }ilanual, seems to regard them as
more nearly related to the Flj-catchers.*

ORNITHOLOGISTS differ in opinion as to whether this biixl is distinct from
Pallas's Grey Shrike (with the single white bar on the wing) : Seebohm con-
sidered the two forms as distinct as the Carrion and Hooded Crows, but
Mr. Howard Saunders brought forward sufficient evidence to show that they had
but little claim to the title of separate species. In his Manual we read : - " Many
of the specimens obtained in winter have a white bar on the primaries only, the
bases of tlie secondaries being black ; whereas in the typical L. cxcubitor the
bases of the secondaries are white, and the wing exhibits a double bar. The form
with only one bar is the L. viajor, of Pallas, and, as shown by Prof. Collett (Ibis,
1886, pp. 30-40) it meets and interbreeds with L. exaibiior in Scandinavia, t3'pical
examples of both races being actually found in the same brood, while intermediate
forms are not uncommon. Where the sexes have been determined, the double-
barred bird has generally proved to be a male, and the single-barred a female.
Dr. Hartert does not regard L. major as a distinct species. Typical L. excubitor
breeds as far east as St. Petersburg, beyond which, in Siberia, L. major
