bird, is quarrelsome, spiteful, and can on no account be trusted in an aviary with
an}' species weaker than itself. It is, moreover, full}' as much trouble to its
owner in respect of food as many a far more attractive species : j-et, according to the
late Rev. H. A. Alacpherson, it has one merit ; although its own song is insig-
nificant, the Hawfinch is not wholl}' destitute of the imitative facult}'. In ni}'
friend the late Charles A. Witchell's interesting work on tlie "Evolution of Bird-
song," we read (p. 172): "Even so poor a songster as the Hawfinch will imitate
when a captive. The Rev. H. A. Macpherson imforms me that they will pick up
any soiinds."

Nevertheless, when a bird has no beaut}^ of form, and when its colouring is
little superior to that of a hen Chaffinch, its song should compensate for other
deficiencies ; and, as Major Alexander von Home3'er remarks (Gefiederte Welt,
Vol. XX, p. 4S9) the cherry-kernel biter is "not gifted with natural song."

It appears to me that, in dealing with British birds, it is far more convenient
to introduce the Bullfinches (the so-called Gro.sbeaks) immediately after the true
Grosbeaks : in their habits the}- are not dissimilar ; whereas, to place them, as
Howard Saunders has done in his " Mauual," between the more slender-billed
Finches and the Buntings, seems rather unnatural : I have, therefore, not followed
him in this respect.

There is not the least doubt that, so far as their habits are concerned, the
most typical Finches (that is the members of the genus Fyi>igiIIa) approach far
more closely to the Buntings than au}' other species of the Subfamily, and next
to I^ri)ioi/ln, I should consider Piisser (in spite of its aberrant nest) to show
relationship to the Emberizina: : I speak as an Avicultiirist of course, and do not
venture to criticize the classification from a structural standpoint.
