The Pink-Grosbeak.

Pyy)linla cmiclcatoy, LiNN.

FROM time to time some five and twenty occurrences of this species in Great
Britain had been recorded previous to 1900; but, as Howard Saunders
says : - " Professor Newton (4th Ed. Yarrell's B. B.) has disposed of all but
five as unworthy of belief; while, to my mind, few even of these sifted records
are entitled to acceptance." In 1905 a small flock appeared near Hawkhurst in
Kent, and subsequently in Ashburuham Park, Sussex ; several specimens being
shot.

It seems to me that even if the species has been shot here, the probabilit}^ is
that (in every case) the examples have either escaped or been freed from confine-
ment ; inasmuch as it is not oul}- imported from time to time as a cage-bird, but
in my short experience (commencing in Jul}' 1896)* the birds, though wonderfully
tame and intelligent, are too powerful and destructive to be trusted with weaker
companions, and eat so voraciously that their food makes a distinct difference in
one's expenses : they are like most insect-eating finches, very fond of earthworms
and green food ; but the quantity of sunflower-seed and hemp which they devour
in a day is astonishing, whilst their chief amusement in my aviar}' consisted in
tearing ivy to pieces. A man in a hurry to part with such birds would be verj^
likely to turn them loose.

There is an interesting account of the breeding of this species in captivity
by Mr. W. H. St. Quintin, in the " Avicultural Magazine" 2nd sec. Vol. V,
PP- .55-56 (1906).
