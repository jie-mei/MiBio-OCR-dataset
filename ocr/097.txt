with the House- Sparrow." It would, therefore, appear that, if properly treated,
this species does become stead}' enough to breed in confinement.

I have been told, by Aviculturists who have kept the Tree-Sparrow, that it
is not tyrannical in an aviar}' ; it must, however, be borne in mind, that an indi-
vidual does not necessaril_y exhibit the characteristics of a species ; even half a
dozen specimens may all be of a peaceful disposition (as was the case with my
Robins, which never fought with any but their own species). Ou the other hand
one vicious Tree-Sparrow, associated with birds weaker than itself, might do much
mischief in a verj' sliort space of time : its powerful beak would enable it to kill
or maim any smaller or weaker bird without the least trouble.

The Chaffinch.

Fiingilla ccclcbs, LiXN.

Although the type of the family FringiUidcc and, therefore, the Finch of
Finches, this species and the Brambling differ much in their habits from
the other British species of typical Finches (Fringi/Iincr) and one is
surprised that any man, having the knowledge of living birds which Seebohm
undoubtedly had, should have been content to place forms with Tit-like habits
(Siskin, Goldfinch, Redpolls) in the same genus with the true species of Fringill
—birds which have the habits of Buntings. If distinctive structural characters
were wholly absent, one could understand it.

The Chaﬃnch is distributed as a breeding species throughout Europe almost
up to the North Cape, but in the south of Europe it chieﬂy haunts the mountains
during the breeding season, wintering in the plains. It occurs locally in Morocco
and Algeria, and winters in Egypt. In Asia it is said to breed in Palestine, Asia
Minor, and Western Persia, and to winter in Turkestan.

In Great Britain the Chaﬃnch is generally distributed; breeding freely in all
