The Goldfinch.

CdJ-LucIis clci^a)is, vSteph.

DR. SHARPE states that this bird iuhabits Europe generally, except the
extreme north ; the Canar}- Islands, Madeira, and the countries bordering
the Mediterranean : it is a winter visitant to Eg3'pt and Palestine. In
Siberia it extends to Omsk and Krasuo3-arsk, and winters in Turkestan.

In Great Britain the Goldfinch is pretty generally distributed throughout
England, and in suitable localites in Scotland and Ireland, though the wholesale
destruction of woods, plantations and so-called waste land has rendered the species
comparatively rare and local in man}- parts of Great Britain. In the north of
Kent, where the nest might be obtained fairly commonly, year after year, about
thirty-five years ago, it is now hardly ever met with, excepting perhaps in
strictly private gardens, pleasure-grounds, and orchards : indeed, I believe it is
fully twenty-three years since I last saw a wild Kentish Goldfinch in the summer-
time.

This is the most beautiful of our British Finches : the adult male has the
forehead broadly satinj'-crimson, extending at the sides as a superciliary streak
which sometimes passes behind the eye and unites with a broad patch of the same
colour on the front of the face below the lores, and on the throat ; the lores, feathers
at base of beak and chin black : crown and feathers behind the cheeks black ;
cheeks snow-white (slightly stained in the centre with buffish-brown, especially
in young birds) continuous with a white belt encircling the back of the throat :
back greyish copper-brown, with a transverse white spot on the nape ; wings blue-
black, occasionally slightly glossed wdth Prussian-green ou the lesser coverts;
greater coverts golden-yellow ; the basal two-thirds of the primaries, excepting the
first, with the outer webs bright golden-yellow, the secondaries also with broad
yellow bases, so that the wing appears to be broadly belted with yellow ; inner
primaries and outer secondaries tipped with white, inner secondaries with buffish-
brown ; upper tail-coverts whitish, washed with buffish-brown, in Continental birds
sometimes white, varied with sienna or reddish-buff; tail feathers blue-black, the
central ones tipped wnili white, the two outer ones with a large oval white patch
