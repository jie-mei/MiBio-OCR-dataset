she is also darker above, more prominentl}' streaked below, and wants the rose-
colouring on the rump, the tliroat, and breast. The youug chiefly differ from the
female in the lack of crimson on the forehead, and in the more sand}' colouring
of the upper parts.

In confinement, the crimson and ros}' colouring entirely disappears after the
first moult, excepting in large and well ventilated aviaries, when it is sometimes
partially retained : this statement also applies to the Lesser Redpoll, the Twite,
and the Linnet.

In its habits, this and all the Redpolls are much alike, restless, fidgety little
creatures, Tit-like in their actions, inquisitive, and mischievous ; but intelligent,
and, therefore, easy to teach all kinds of meaningless tricks : principally on account
of the last qualification they have become favourite cage-birds with that class of
persons which is charmed with what is unnatural. To the true lover of nature
a talking bird may be amusing, because it is the nature of many birds to imitate
sounds ; but a performing bird is offensive.

Seebohm (Hist. British Birds, Vol. II, pp. 118- 119) has some interesting
observations on the habits of this species, both abroad and in this country, which
are worth noting. He says that in winter they are principally ground-feeders,
which we should have expected to be the case from what we know of Linnets and
Goldfinches; like which birds they "alight in a flock on a bed of dead thistles,"
and amuse themselves by picking them to pieces. He also records the fact of
their picking seeds from the droppings of horses on the roads ; which is instructive,
as showing that they look upon oats and kindred grain as wholesome food ; a
fact which aviculture taught me many years ago.

The nest of the Mealy Redpoll is usually placed in the fork of a birch-tree
at no great height from the ground , it has also been found in grass-tussocks ; it
is neatly constructed of twigs, bents, strips of bark, and lichens, or moss ; the
lining of willow-catkins, vegetable-down, hair, wool, and sometimes feathers. The
eggs number from five to six, and vary in colour from pale greenish to
pale bluish, with dark brown surface-spots, and paler red-brown underlying
markings.

Although there is no satisfactory evidence to prove that the Mealy Redpoll
has ever bred in Great Britain, a male in breeding-plumage was observed at
Riddlesworth, in July, 1848, and noticed by Prof. Alfred Newton in the " Zoologist"
(^p. 2382) ; still this bird may possibly have escaped from an out-door aviary after
a few months confinement.

The song of this species, if such it can be called, is merely a prolonged
trill, such as may be imitated either by vibrating the soft palate as you whistle.
