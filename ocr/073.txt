I always purchase my Goldfinches as "Grey-pates"; and as they have plenty
of exercise and abundance of nourishing food, ruy birds when adult are frequently
mistaken by breeders for "Russians"; when first turned out they always have
plenty of hemp and teasel, with groundsel and chickweed ; and there is usually a
saucer of soft-food in the aviary : the colours of the male birds are wonderfully
pure and brilliant, and the birds themselves are large and well-formed.

Mule-breeding between Goldfinch and Canary is easy enough, for I was
successful in my first essay ; but between the Goldfinch and other Finches, there
is more difficulty (although this species sometimes hybridizes with the Greenfinch
in a wild state) especially in the case of the only reality handsome cross — between
the Goldfinch and Bullfinch. The variety of Goldfinch known as a " Cheverel "
is sometimes preferred for muling purposes ; it diifers from the normal form in
having the centre of the throat white.

The bird-catchers assert that Goldfinches from different parts of our islands
sing differently ; and they call the best singers " Slammers," from a fancied
resemblance of part of the song to the words — " Slam-so-witty, slippity-cur," with
other rubbish which no bird could whistle.

The Mealy Redpoll.

Acanihis liiiaria, LiNN.

SEEBOHM treats the Redpolls as races of one species, but considers that the
typical form, A. linaria, and the two extremes, A. ni/csccus and A.
Iiorncmanni, are worthy of subspecific rank ; at least that seems to me to
be the only construction to be put upon his observations. Howard Saunders, on
the other hand, unites A. linaria and A. horncmanni, remarking: — "for the sake
of convenience, I propose to treat the Mealy Redpolls under one heading, and to
