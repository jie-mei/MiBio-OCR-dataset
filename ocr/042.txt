FAMILY FRINGILLID.€.

THIS famil}' consists of a uumber of hard-billed, largely seed-eatiug, birds.
Howard Saimders 011I3' distinguishes these as Finches fFrin^HluurJ and
Buntings (E>i!beyiziHaJ ; but the Catalogue of Birds, of the British Museum,
regards the Grosbeaks as constituting a third Subfamily (Coccothraitstiiuc). Seebohm
agreed with Howard Saunders in uniting the latter Subfamily to the typical
Finches ; but, in my opinion, there is more difficulty in distinguishing between
some of the foreign Buntings, aud Grosbeaks, than between the latter and the true
Finches. I would, in any case, rather err on the side of too much regard for
structural differences, than on the opposite side.

The F) hio'iUidcr have the tenth primary, which is often well-developed, con-
cealed by a longer covert ; it has thus escaped observation aud been asserted to
be non-existent ; the bill is hard and conical, aud is (to my mind) better described
by the term "beak"; the Finches feed their young from the crop, regurgitating
the food when partially- digested : naturally during the breeding season, I believe
all are more or less insectivorous, although seed forms their staple food : in
confinement, however, many of the Finches will live for many years upon seed
alone.

The CoccothraiisibuT, or Grosbeaks, of which the Hawfinches are typical, are
characterized by a very heavy and powerful beak, with hardly any angle to the
chin ; the nasal bones produced backwards beyond the front margin of the eye-
socket, (cf. R. B. Sharpe, Cat. Birds, Vol. XII).

The Fringillincc, or true Finches, the type of which is our English Chaffinch,
usually have a somewhat less powerful beak, with the angle of the chin slightly
more defined, but still ver}' feebly shown ; the mandibles almost terminating at
the same point ; the nasal bones not produced backwards beyond the front margin
of the eye-socket.

The E»ib€risi)ur, or Buntings, of which our Yellow Ammer ma}' be considered
typical, have a well-marked angle to the chin ; the lower mandible terminating
well within the upper one, and not complete!}' closing in the centre of the cutting
edge ; the more typical Buntings also have a hard horny knob on the palate, and
a compression of the lower mandible to meet it ; they also walk when on the
earth, and are largely insectivorous (in which respects the}' approach the Chaffinch
and Brambling among the true Finches) : many Buntings, however, are not walking
birds.

The Fringillida are favourite cage-birds, chiefly on account of the ease with
which their food can be provided.
