to tlie top of a high hawthorn hedge to discover the contents of a nest." vS. A.
Davies, ("Zoologist" 1892, p. 29), remarks that: - "In Norwaj- they nearly always
prefer bushes, if procurable. Whilst travelling in 1890, in the Saetersdal, I
observed that- as noticed by Mr. Saunders in his 'Manual of British Birds,' - very
often the nests were built under the eaves of the houses. In some cases the
peasants had placed large props under the eaves for the nest to rest upon : in
others the nest appeared to be built half inside the house, between gaps in the
timbers. The Magpie is regarded as a bird of good omen, and it is constantly
encouraged as much as possible to nest near the house. In one place I saw, in
a low fir-tree close to a house, no less than nine Magpies' nests. I never heard
before of Magpies nesting in colonies." Lord Lilford says that in Spain he
frequently met with " nests which could be examined without any climbing, and,
still more, whose contents were attainable from horseback : " he also, as recorded
b}' Howard Saunders, " found several nests in the papyrus reeds of the Anapo,
near Syracuse."

The nest itself is ver^^ bulk}' and when built openly is alwaj-s roofed over
with a basket-like covering of thorny sticks, between which and the nest proper,
which is made of the same materials cemented together with mud, there is only
a narrow entrance : the cup of the nest is very deep and neatly lined with rootlets.

The eggs number from six to eight, rarely nine, and are pale emerald green
(or exceptiouall}' fleshy-white) ; a clutch of five in my collection obtained in the
village of Bobbing in Kent, in May, 1888, are uniforml}^ flecked all over with
short irregular olive markings interspersed with dots of the same colour ; but
others have the spotting massed at the larger, or more rarely, at the smaller end,
and in some cases there are blotches and streaks of brown among the other markings,
and I have seen eggs coloured and marked like those of the Pied Wagtail.*

The male bird takes his share in the duties of incubation.

The food of this bird consists of snails, worms, insects and their larvae, eggs,
3-oung birds, mice, carrion ; and later in the year, fruit, beech-mast, and acorns,
as well as grain when procurable. Early in August, 1879, Mr. Frohawk saw
considerable flocks feeding on the fallows in North Devon.

The natural note of the IMagpie is a harsh chattering ; but, like some of the
other Crows he is a good mimic and, as Swaysland observes, "is easily taught to
talk." Lord Lilford remarks : - " In confinement or, more properly speaking, in
semi-captivity, the Magpie is a very amusing bird, but his ceaseless chatter is, to
our ears, most unmusical and annoying, and his thieving- and hiding-instincts have
long been historically famous or infamous.
