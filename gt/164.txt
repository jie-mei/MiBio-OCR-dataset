sets oﬀ to ﬂy to some point, changes his mind, swings gracefully round and
alights on the exact spot from which he started; indeed he is very fond of
aerial evolutions; his wings are rapidly ﬂapped when on the wing, and when he
alights on the ground he generally comes down with either a see-sawing or spiral
motion. On the ground he is almost as fussy as a Starling in his search for
worms or leather-jackets of which I have seen him carry many to his nest from
my garden: undoubtedly he does fulﬁl his duties in the scheme of nature.

The cries of this bird have been variously described as cae, caw, quick, jack,
&c., but the only notes which I have heard uttered by wild Jackdaws have been
chack and chark, from which sounds, without question, its name has been derived:
its note is utterly unlike that of the Rook or any of the other British Crows.

The Jackdaw as a rule is gregarious in its habits; although in the suburbs,
a pair will sometimes take possession of a chimney, in which they will build
alone; consorting, however, when feeding, with the Rooks which inhabit some
avenue of elms in the neighbourhood: but, whenever possible, this species breeds
in colonies, the nest being almost invariably placed in some crevice or hole in
rock, building, tree,* or even a rabbit-burrow; ivy-clad ruins and belfries of old
churches being favourite sites.

Nidiﬁcation commences in April or May, frequently not until the latter month,
and the nest varies considerably in bulk according to the site in which it is con‐
structed; it is always carelessly formed and generally of the veriest rubbish;
wool and moss are often used, but those which I have found in belfries consisted
merely of sticks and a little dirty straw, with a few feathers; whilst one in my
collection taken from the winding staircase leading up to the belfry of old Milton
Church, near Sittingbourne, on 25th May, 1887, consists of a great mass of hair
(either the winter-coat of horses, or refuse from a barber’s) with a little loose earth,
a dead leaf or two, and a little dirty straw: the depression for the eggs is very
shallow.

The eggs number from four to six and vary a good deal, but the commonest
type is pale blue, more or less boldly spotted with sepia, and with lavender-grey
shell-spots; sometimes the spots are absent, and I have seen a few eggs in which
the markings were small, numerous, and pale, almost resembling eggs of the Magpie.

The Jackdaw pairs for life: it rears only one brood in a season. Its food
consists in summer chieﬂy of worms, all kinds of injurious grubs, especially those
of the crane-ﬂy, the cockchafer, the wireworm, also insects, mollusca, and (it must
alas be admitted) eggs and young of other birds, grain, peas and early fruits:
