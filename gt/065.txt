again, the same might be said of other species with equal fairness, yet I think
he may have been correct.

THE SISKIN.

Chrysomitris spinus, LINN.

THE distribution of the Siskin or Aberdevine* extends throughout Europe to
the limit of conifer growth: in Africa it is said to occur during severe
winters in Morocco and Algeria; it is also found in Northern Asia, and
across Siberia to China and Japan.

In Great Britain during the summer months the Siskin is chiefly confined to
the fir-woods of the north, consequently it is somewhat local in its distribution;
in some parts of Scotland and Ireland it is fairly abundant as a breeding species,
as also in some of the northern counties of England: it has, moreover, been
known occasionally to breed in Surrey, Sussex, and I am tolerably sure that it
has bred at Keston, in Kent, near to the lakes, where there is a belt of tall
conifers, for I saw a pair there early in June, 1886, and heard the male singing
its sprightly song, with the unmistakeable hurdy-gurdy finish. Since 1898 it has
been recorded as breeding in Shropshire, Derby, Yorkshire and probably Suther-
land. In the winter the distribution of the Siskin is much more general, extending
into Western Scotland and the South of England.

The adult male has the general colouring of the upper parts olive-green with
darker shaft-streaks, the rump much more yellow, showing the shaft-streaks
distinctly at the junction with the lower part of the back; crown of head black;
wings black, the coverts tipped with yellow, the flights with white diffused borders
