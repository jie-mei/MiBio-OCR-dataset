occasion I called upon them to try and obtain a cock bird for breeding purposes;
and, seeing that they had paired a Greenﬁnch and hen Canary in one of their
cages, I asked why they were trying to breed such ugly unremunerative mules.
They replied that their stock was getting weak, and they always introduced Green-
ﬁnch blood when their birds were falling oﬀ in vigour, and then bred out the
taint, pairing the mules with Canaries. This has been supposed an impossibility;

been bred from hybrids, paired with either parent stock, have been exhibited at
the Crystal Palace.

THE HAWFINCH.

Coccothraustes vulgaris, PALLAS.

THIS extremely ungainly bird is distributed over nearly the whole of Europe;
breeding in Russia as far northwards as St. Petersburg, but only visiting
Scandinavia in the winter; its range extends eastwards to Asia Minor,
and the Caucasus, and possibly to Northern Persia and Turkestan. On the
African Continent a few examples breed in Algeria, and the species has been
known to straggle as far northward as Egypt.

In Great Britain the Hawﬁnch is local, but according to the late Howard
Saunders has been increasing in numbers for the past ﬁfty years; he attributes
this fact to the increase of market-gardens. Formerly it was rare in Wales and
the extreme western counties from Cornwall to Cumberland; but breeding in suitable
localities in most of the counties of England and in Ireland. To Scotland it is
still chieﬂy an accidental winter visitant, though one nest was obtained in 1903
near Newport, in the east of Fifeshire.

Although the form of the Hawﬁnch is anything but graceful, its colouring is
