The Twite, Mountain Linnet, Hill Lintie, or "Yellow-neb Lintie," as it is
variously called, is a frequenter in summer of the hilly districts and moorlands of
the northern portions of Great Britain and Ireland; but, as winter approaches,
it deserts the bleaker regions and wanders in small flocks through the cultivated
lowlands in search of seeds of charlock and other weeds, upon which it feeds: at
this season it frequently consorts with the Linnet.

Lord Lilford says that his acquaintance with this species is chiefly confined
to having often met with it on the moors of Scotland, when Grouse-shooting in
August and September. "At that season it is generally to be met with in small
family parties of six or eight, flitting about grassy spots amongst the heather,
and feeding on various small seeds. It may be distinguished, even at some
distance, from the Common Linnet on the wing by its lighter make, darker colour,
and sharp call-note. In captivity this species becomes very tame, but has not
much to recommend it, as the song, though sweet, is short, broken, and of
little power."

The call-note has been described as resembling the word twah-it of which the
name Twite is a fanciful rendering; on the wing it twitters, somewhat in the
fashion of the Linnet; the song, though inferior, is not much unlike that of the
same bird.

The nest of the Twite is usually built low down in heather, sometimes even
on the ground among grass, or on a rocky ledge; it is also said to occur in
bushes, and occasionally in ivy: it is neatly formed of rootlets, or heather inter-
mingled with grass-bents, and is lined with wool, hair and feathers, or thistle-
down. The eggs number from four to six, usually five, are pale greenish-blue,
speckled, spotted, blotched, or streaked with reddish-brown; they are indistinguish-
able from those of the Linnet, though most observers seem to agree in saying
that they are more frequently streaked than eggs of that bird. As a matter of
fact, if a number of eggs of the Goldfinch, Lesser Redpoll, Twite, and Linnet
were indiscriminately mixed, no living Ornithologist could sort them again with
any degree of confidence: they all vary in size, depth, and tint of colouring and
markings.

Although I am satisfied that the Twite could, as easily as other Finches,
complete its nest in two or three days provided it was ready to lay, Saxby has
recorded an instance in which both sexes were occupied for eight days in completing
one: this is often the case at the commencement of the breeding season,* when
the birds are in no special hurry, just as with Canaries in the breeding-cage, but
