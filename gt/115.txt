greenish-white, one of them with only a few delicate hair-lines, a second with a
single additional rectangular line across the lower third enclosing a second shorter
club-shaped line, the two other eggs were fairly normal in marking; another nest
of four is slightly tinted with lavender, the markings are mostly fine, and look
like tangled silk, mixed with a few thicker streaks of purplish-black, one of these
eggs is almost a perfect sphere; other greenish eggs have extraordinary markings
(like written notes in music, oriental letters, or the little men which children
sometimes draw on their slates) intermixed with finer scrawlings and patches of
lavender; the lavender tinted eggs chiefly differ in being clouded with a deeper
shade of the same colour, often at the larger end; one egg which I obtained
vaguely resembles that of a Chaffinch, being of the same size and with very few
linear markings, only the diffused patches are greyish-lavender, instead of looking
like blood-stains.

The number of eggs in a clutch varies from four to five, four being the
commoner number; if less are obtained in an incubated condition, either the first
nest has been destroyed before the completion of the clutch, or one or more eggs
abstracted or broken accidentally. During incubation the hen bird sits very close;
so that frequently you may almost tread upon the nest in stepping through tangled
brushwood; then fferrelup! that sound of hurried flight familiar to the birds'-nester,
makes you suddenly look to catch a glimpse of the startled bird rounding a bush,
or passing over a hedge; and in a minute you are crouching down and turning
aside the foliage to look at its treasures: often when searching among brambles
and hawthorn have I felt my hand brushed by the wing of this bird as it has
started from its nest.

I am satisfied that three, if not four, broods are reared in a year: the male
is said, on good authority, to assist the female in incubation, but in every instance
in which I have flushed the bird from the nest, it has invariably been the hen;
indeed the male has always been singing somewhere close by. It is well-known
that the hens of many species as they grow old assume a plumage closely resemb-
ling that of the male bird; therefore, unless a cock of this species has actually
been shot, or at least been heard to sing, upon the nest, and its sex proved, I
think the statement that it assists the hen in her duties, should be received with
a certain amount of hesitation.*

The food of the Yellow Hammer in the breeding-season consists largely of
insects and their larv√¶; also, like all the Buntings, this species devours insects
whenever it can obtain them; but, like all more or less insectivorous birds, it is
