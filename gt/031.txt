FAMILY HIRUNDINIDÆ.

SEEBOHM widely dissevers the Swallows from the Flycatchers, placing them
immediately after the Buntings; possibly because of the fact that the tenth
primary is small and concealed by the upper covert, but is not absent as
Seebohm states. He says that they "are distinguished by their long pointed
wings, slender, wide bills, and small legs and feet. The * * * * ninth
primary is generally the longest. The tarsus is scutellated in front, and the tail
is generally forked. The most marked feature in the Swallows is that they have
no autumn moult, their new dress being assumed in February."

The broad bill, small feet, and long pointed wings of the Swallows, appear to
me to show some affinity to the Flycatchers; whilst I find that Hemichelidon fuli-
ginosus, which Jerdon placed among the most typical Flycatchers of India, is said
to have "very much the aspect of a Swallow, both in colour and structure" (Birds
of India, Vol. I, p. 458). That certainly seems a hardly natural classification, which
interposes the whole of the Crows, Waxwings, Starlings, and Finches, between two
groups of birds so similar in their methods of feeding, and so eminently fitted for
an aerial existence as the Flycatchers and Swallows.

The Hirundinidæ constitute a large, interesting, and widely distributed family
of very beautiful birds; their nests, familiar to everyone, are triumphs of skill
and perseverance; and, as regards our three British species, show good distinctive
features.

Although it would hardly be supposed that Swallows were suitable subjects
for aviculture; attempts have been made, with varying success, to keep the whole
of our three species: but, to preserve the health of such active birds, a great deal
of exercise is a necessity, and a very large aviary a consequent requisite: as cage-
birds, Swallows frequently quickly succumb to indigestion from over-feeding, and
lack of exercise.
