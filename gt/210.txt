Family—MOTACILLIDÆ.

THE BLACK‐HEADED WAGTAIL.

Motacilla melanocephala, LICHT.

A male was shot near Willingdon, on May 13th, 1906; it is also a race of
M. ﬂava, as are the two following.

Family—MOTACILLIDÆ.

SYKES’ WAGTAIL.

Motacilla beema, SYKES.

A male was obtained at Rottingdean, Sussex, on April 20th, I898.

Family—MOTACILLIDÆ.

THE ASHY‐HEADED WAGTAIL.

Motacilla cinereocapilla, SAVI.

THE ﬁrst example was shot many years ago near Penzance, and a second at
Sheringham, Norfolk (in May ?) 1842.

I cannot say I have much faith in the distinctness of the above, even as sub‐
species, from M. ﬂava, but the tendency amongst Ornithologists nowadays is to
split hairs; if it amuses them I do not object.
