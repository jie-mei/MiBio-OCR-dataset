Family-MOTACILLIDÆ.

THE BLACK-HEADED WAGTAIL.

Motacilla melanocephala, LICHT.

A male was shot near Willingdon, on May 13th, 1906; it is also a race of
M. flava, as are the two following.

Family-MOTACILLIDÆ.

SYKES' WAGTAIL.

Motacilla beema, SYKES.

A male was obtained at Rottingdean, Sussex, on April 20th, 1898.

Family-MOTACILLIDÆ.

THE ASHY-HEADED WAGTAIL.

Motacilla cinereocapilla, SAVI.

THE first example was shot many years ago near Penzance, and a second at
Sheringham, Norfolk (in May ?) 1842.

I cannot say I have much faith in the distinctness of the above, even as sub-
species, from M. flava, but the tendency amongst Ornithologists nowadays is to
split hairs; if it amuses them I do not object.
