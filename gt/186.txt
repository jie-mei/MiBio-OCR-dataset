runner," an elongated cage about two feet in length, by nine inches high, wired
in front only. In one corner I fixed a Sedge-Warbler's nest, put my birds in one
by one, keeping my hand over to prevent their jumping out until all were inside,
when I covered them with a warm flannel. When they began to get hungry off
went the blanket and the whole family tumbled out of bed and stood in a row in
front of the door shouting-tee-u, tee-u, tee-u; and after their meal they raced up
and down their cage until weary, and then tumbled back into bed and I covered
them up again. They seemed strong and sound, but one by one they got cramp
and died until I had lost them all.

I subsequently purchased a young male and an old female and at first kept
them together, but finding that they did not get on well together I separated
them, keeping the male bird in an ordinary Lark-cage and the female in an aviary
where she contented herself with running backwards and forwards continually over
about a foot of ground, never flying, excepting when startled, when she flew up
recklessly and fell back regardless of consequences to the detriment of her plumage.
The male turned out a good singer and was so tame that he used to peck and
pull at my finger when I put it through the wires; he was also very intelligent
and would claw the wires and look round at a bottle containing watercress, of
which he was very fond, evidently asking me to give him some.

In July, 1887, I obtained two nestling Sky-Larks and brought them up upon
my Nightingale food, and in October they both began to sing, but one of them
died the following year; the other made a grand singer, and used to introduce
the song of the Persian Bulbul into the middle of its performance: it lived for
several years.

In May, 1888, I took a nest of three young Larks when they were only six
days old (I first saw them as eggs) and was obliged to take them when I did, as
I was then returning home. Although they all had a touch of cramp, I success-
fully reared them, but during their autumn moult two of them died; the third,
which was a wonderfully tame little bird, I turned loose in an aviary where it was
quite happy; it used to strut about in a consequential manner with its crest up,
and although it was a small bird it sang so well that I felt certain it must be a
cock and never examined it; eventually it settled the point by laying an egg.
This bird was very fond of perching upon a branch with the long hind toe and
claw hanging straight down over the back of it, but it always roosted on the earth
after the manner of its species.*

Judging by my own experience of rearing Sky-Larks I am inclined to think
that a turf in the cage, with a hole cut in it, and a Whitethroat's nest fixed
