Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote, of Cambridge, who has kept all the British Corvidæ at
various times, with the exception of the Raven, writes as follows:-"The Magpie
is a nice sprightly bird, and when hand-reared is beautifully tame: he seems to
be the least pugnaceous of this rather vicious family. His merry rattling note is
a nice change from the ordinary croak so frequently uttered."

Like all the Crow-family, this bird if caged should not be closely confined;
the cage for a Magpie or Jay should be at least five feet in length, over three
feet in height and two feet in width; otherwise the bird does not get sufficient
exercise, misses his daily bath and often becomes ragged and unsightly.

Family-CORVIDÆ.

THE JACKDAW.

Corvus monedula, LINN.

BREEDS and is resident throughout the greater part of Europe, but does
not occur northwards beyond central Scandinavia; southwards in the
Mediterranean basin it becomes very local: it has straggled along the
African coast as far as the Canaries. In Asia it occurs northwards in Western
Siberia as far as lat. 60°; but in the valley of the Yenesei, Seebohm only observed
it as far north as lat. 56°; southwards it is common in South Russia, Turkestan,
westwards through the Caucasus to Asia Minor and Palestine, and southwards to
Cashmere and Afghanistan where it breeds, visiting the plains of N.W. India in
the winter.

In Great Britain it breeds and is resident in most suitable localities; though
on the rock-bound portions of our coasts it is frequently replaced by the Chough;
the two species being very rarely found occupying the same district. In the Outer
Hebrides it has not been met with, and to the Shetlands it is only a straggler.
