Family—CORVIDÆ.

THE RAVEN.

Corvus corax, LINN.

DISTRIBUTED throughout Europe from the limit of land in the north to
the Mediterranean in the south and throughout northern Asia to the
Himalayas; whilst in America it extends across the continent from the
Paciﬁc to Greenland and southwards to Guatemala and possibly Honduras, though
to the east of the Mississippi it is somewhat rare and local.

In England, probably owing to the systematic persecution to which it has
been subjected, the Raven is becoming very rare, though a few pairs still breed
regularly in the rocky headlands of our southern and south-western coasts.
Howard Saunders observes that nests built in trees, although far rarer than
formerly, are less uncommon than might be supposed at short distances inland.
Not long ago several pairs bred in Essex. To this I can add that in the winter
of 1885-6 a pair of Ravens used daily to pass over my garden at Penge (where I
then lived) and on mentioning the fact to a friend in the train he told me he
knew of a pair which had a nest in the spring of 1885 not far from Beckenham,
but he intended to keep its situation to himself, lest I should be tempted to try
and secure the eggs.

In Scotland, and particularly the Outer Hebrides and other Western Isles
northwards to the Shetlands, it is still common; whilst it is found in the wilder
regions of Ireland.

The Raven is glossy black, with iridescent purple and Prussian blue tints on
the upper parts and throat; bill and feet black, iris brown. The female is
smaller, and less distinctly shot with purple and blue; her bill is slightly shorter.
The young resemble the female, but lack the metallic gloss of adult birds.

The bird of Odin is widely regarded with superstitious awe; its sable
colouring, gruﬀ croaking notes, and its delight in carrion, however foul and
putrid, have doubtless conspired to stamp it as a bird of evil omen; yet, to watch
a pair of Ravens at play, gives one no feeling of horror or disgust; for their
foolish antics and absurd lateral jumps are irresistibly laughable.
