The Tree-Pipit occurs at Fair Isle, Shetlands, as a bird of spring and autumn
passage, according to W. E. Clarke; it has been observed on Scilly in the
autumn.

A male of the Red-throated Pipit was shot in Achill, co. Mayo, on May 26th,
1895; a second in co. Donegal, on August 9th, 1898, but the latter was considered
doubtful; a young female was obtained at Ninﬁeld (Sussex), on November 26th,
1901.

In 1903 four Tawny Pipits were shot in September, at Rye Harbour (Sussex),
and a pair on the August following; another was shot, on the following month
at Bexhill; a female was caught at Yarmouth, in October 1897, and a male at
Bodmin (Cornwall), in September 1899. Richard’s Pipit has also been met with
in Cornwall, North Wales, Scilly and Kentish Knock.

A good many occurrences of the Water-Pipit have been recorded:—one from
Freshwater (Isle of Wight), in September 1865; one in Scilly, May 1903; one
at Milcomb (Oxford), March 1903; one in Norfolk, January 1905; one at
Littlestone (Kent), 1906, and altogether over a score in Sussex.
