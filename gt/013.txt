One advantage in this bird is—that however wild it may be, and however
intolerable the odour of its cage may be, the bird always appears to enjoy robust
health. Even if one is ill, and perchance no fresh food is supplied to this bird
for twenty-four hours, he makes no trouble of that, but only attacks his food more
vigorously when the opportunity comes. Moreover, having by foolish behaviour
so reduced his wings that he cannot reach his perch, he contentedly passes the
night on a box in a corner. These are redeeming points in his character.

Family—LANIIDÆ.

THE WOODCHAT SHRIKE.

Lanius pomeranus, SPARRM.

HOWARD SAUNDERS observes that “On the Continent the Woodchat
breeds as far to the north-east as the line of the Baltic and the valley of
the Vistula, beyond which it is of accidental occurrence; while southward
it is generally distributed throughout Europe, and in the countries bordering on
the Mediterranean is very abundant. Even there, however, it is only a visitor;
arriving about the end of March, or early in April, and leaving again between
August and October. Eastward it breeds in South Russia, Turkey, Asia Minor,
Palestine, and Persia; while in winter it occurs in Arabia, and down the East
African Coast to about 5˚ N. lat., also on the west side to the Gambia and the
Gold Coast. Throughout Northern Africa it is abundant in summer, arriving from
the southern side of the Sahara in March.”

To Great Britain this species is an irregular straggler, and principally on
migration; nevertheless about thirty-seven examples have been obtained in various
parts of England, chieﬂy in the southern and eastern counties, one male was seen
in May 1903 at Speeton, in Yorkshire, and, on two occasions, it has been recorded
as breeding at Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight.
