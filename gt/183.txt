Practically the Alaudidæ constitute an Old World family, one species only
occurring in North America, whilst, as Jerdon observes, "They are very sparingly
represented in Malayana and Australia."

Family-ALAUDIDÆ.

THE SKY-LARK.

Alauda arvensis, LINN.

FOUND during the summer months throughout the whole of Europe; nesting
in Scandinavia as far north as lat. 70°, whilst in North Africa it breeds
sparingly as far south as the slopes of the Atlas Mountains, and in the
east, in Russia and Siberia, and at high elevations in Japan, the valley of the
Amoor, South-east Mongolia, Turkestan and Persia. In winter it visits China,
North-west India, Afghanistan, Persia, Asia Minor, Palestine and Egypt. It has
been met with at Madeira, and is reputed to have occurred on Greenland. It has
also been introduced into the United States,* New Zealand and Australia.

Throughout Great Britain and Ireland, the Sky-Lark is widely distributed,
abundant, and (excepting in the extreme north) resident.

The climatic variations of the Sky-Lark have been separated under several
distinctive names, such as A. dulcivox, A. japonica, A. cantarella, A. liopus, A. blak-
istoni, A. gulgula, A. australis, A. cælivox, A. wattersi, and A. sala; but so many
intergrades exist that Ornithologists generally are now content to regard them as
one variable species.

Our Sky-Lark in breeding-plumage has the upper parts golden brown, with
blackish centres to the feathers; edges of greater wing-coverts paler; the outer-
most tail-feather white, with the exception of a blackish streak on the inner web;
