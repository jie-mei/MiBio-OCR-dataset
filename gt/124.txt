by examples of Liothrix and Zosterops: it also ate a good many oats, in addition
to Canary and other seeds.

In spite of their usually placid behaviour, this and all the Buntings are very
pretty additions to a mixed aviary; their plumage being as a rule quite uninjured
and scrupulously clean. Although perhaps not so passionately fond of bathing as
some of the more typical Finches, they perform their ablutions once or twice each
day in a methodical and business-like manner, which is probably quite as effective
as the hurried splashing, characteristic of a Goldfinch or Canary.
