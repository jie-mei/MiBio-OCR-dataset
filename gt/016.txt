In contradiction to the statement of Mr. C. A. Wright respecting the shyness
of the Woodchat, excepting when defending its young, Lord Lilford's observations
are interesting; for he states that the "Woodchat is a very familiar and fearless
bird, and seems often to prefer the vicinity of human habitations for its nest. In
all its habits this Shrike seems to me to approach closely to the Fly-catchers."
Seebohm also says of L. pomeranus (which, however, in common with most Ornith-
ologists, he calls L. rufus) "It is not a wary bird, and, with due precaution, may
be quite closely approached." It is, therefore, probable that this species would not
be difficult to tame, if kindly treated.
