what one notices between the sexes of many butterflies. The different form of
the wing in the sexes of birds appears rarely to be noted, the mere length being
recorded. The radius and ulna in the male are longer and the depression in front
of their junction with the humerus deeper than in the female, the primary coverts
are less exposed in the male, whilst the second, third, and fourth longer primaries are
emarginate in front, in the male; but only the second and third, in the female;
in the latter sex the primaries are more perfectly graded, whereas in the male
the outer edge forms a slight sinus; the tail differs much in outline, as will be
at once seen from the cut.

Young birds are very like the female. After the autumn moult the feathers
of the crown and breast have greyish borders, the crimson being dull and presenting
a mottled appearance; this (in fully adult males) gradually changes to the bright
colouring at the approach of spring.*
