THE LESSER REDPOLL.

Acanthis rufescens, VIEILLOT.

OCCURS in Western Europe, and probably breeds in some of the mountains
of the South-West; one nest having been obtained from the Veglio Alps,
in Italy, about 7,000 feet above the sea-level.
In Great Britain this Redpoll is resident, breeding most freely in the north
of England and Ireland, and in well-timbered localities in Scotland, more particu-
larly in plantations of birch. This bird is, however, by no means restricted to
the north of England, or Ireland, during the breeding-season; its nest having
been found in most of the southern counties to the east of Somerset, in the north
of which county it has also bred: in Kent, I believe, it breeds regularly, though
not abundantly, every year.*

The upper surface, of the adult male in breeding-plumage is ruddy olive-
brown, longitudinally streaked on each feather with blackish; wings and tail
darker brown, with pale margins; innermost secondaries broadly margined; median
and greater coverts with broad buffish tips; crown bright satiny crimson in front;
rump washed with rosy-red; lores and centre of throat black; sides of head and
throat golden olive-brown; breast rose-red; sides and flanks golden olive-brown,
streaked with blackish; belly white, stained with buffish; beak ochreous-yellow,
