boring a hole into the centre of the trunk and pouring in shot; the gardener
who empties a charge of shot into the branches of his fruit-trees, can, therefore,
hardly expect them to be beneﬁted thereby. If he were wise he would bait a
cage-trap, catch his Bullﬁnches and sell them at a shilling apiece for cage-birds:
they would, even then, die quite soon enough to satisfy any feelings of enmity
which he might nourish, for my experience of these birds in captivity is—that it
is quite exceptional for them to become really tame even in large aviaries;
consequently, unless hand-reared, they rarely live for more than eighteen months
in captivity.

When ﬁrst turned loose in an aviary, a cock Bullﬁnch always creates a panic;
his brilliant colouring seems to greatly alarm other Finches, so that his ﬂight
through the midst of them produces much the same result as the rush of a bull
through a crowded street. Yet this powerful looking bird is really most inoﬀensive;
if annoyed he only opens his mouth and makes grimaces, and if he does become
tame, he is not long in doing so: one which I had was tempted to take sunﬂower-
seeds from my ﬁngers three weeks after its capture: a Canary, with which I
paired it, was far less afraid of it than our indigenous Finches were.

THE SCARLET ROSE‐FINCH.

Carpodacus erythrinus, PALL.

A FULL account of this species will be found in my book “Foreign Finches
in Captivity.” I do not admit its claim to be called British, for although
ﬁve examples have been obtained in England, one at Brighton, in 1869,
and the other at Hampstead in the following year, it is quite possible that both
