Rhine, near Mulheim, I found the Corn-Bunting abundantly established on the
lower grounds. During great heat the males sang incessantly (their mates were
sitting) perching indiﬀerently on the ground, on low bushes and rails, on the tops
of walnut trees, and on the telegraph wires. Their song seemed to be identical
with the dialect of those I had met with at home, with a single exception. On
June 19th, a Corn-Bunting perching on a telegraph wire poured forth a liquid and
sweet song, embodying the notes of the Crested Lark, which latter species is
resident, though scarce, in that district. That the Reed Bunting has a good ear,
and can be trained to sing the Skylark’s song I have recorded elsewhere, but I
never suspected the Corn-Bunting of a similar capacity.”

THE YELLOW BUNTING.

Emberiza citrinella, LINN.

THE Yellow Ammer or Hammer, as this bird is generally called (from the
German name Goldammer, which means Golden Bunting)* is generally
distributed throughout the greater part of Europe, breeding in Scandinavia
as far north as lat. 70°, and in the valley of the Ob, in Siberia, up to lat 64°.
To the more northern portions of its range it is only a summer visitor, and it only
visits the more southern portions in the winter, but in the temperate regions it
is resident; in winter it occurs southwards through Turkey into N.W. Persia
and Turkestan. Although almost unknown in S.W. Spain, it is said to be resident
in Teneriﬀe.

Throughout Great Britain this species is abundant and generally distributed,
breeding everywhere excepting, perhaps, in the Shetlands.
