THE MAGPIE.

Pica rustica, SCOP.

BEAUTIFUL beyond all our other Crows, the Magpie unhappily has so many
enemies among game-preservers, that its numbers in some parts of Great
Britain have sadly diminished. Its distribution is most clearly deﬁned by
Howard Saunders:—“From the North Cape in Scandinavia southward, it is found,
more or less plentifully throughout Europe, except in the islands of Corsica and
Sardinia; but it does not occur in Palestine, although found in Asia Minor.
Eastward—subject to a variation in the amount of white in the plumage, which
has led to the creation of several bad species—the Magpie is found across Asia
to India, China and Japan, and also in the northern portion of America from the
Paciﬁc to Michigan.”

In England, Wales and Scotland, this species is still fairly common and
widely distributed. In Ireland it is not only abundant, but its numbers are in‐
creasing. Perhaps the comparative scarcity of this species at the present time in
some of the southern counties may be due almost as much to the wholesale de‐
struction of timber, which has of late years been carried on by land-owners, as to
the undoubted enmity which game-keepers show to it. In a wood near Newington,
on the Chatham and Dover line, I have often seen several pairs both of this bird
and the Jay simultaneously ﬂying up from their feeding-ground in a small-clearing;
but now that wood is converted into pasturage and hop-gardens: and the same
may be said of many a once grand hunting-ground for the Naturalist, for miles
and miles around that neighbourhood. Alas for Kent, once the garden of England!
it is rapidly becoming a mere dreary expanse of wire-fenced ﬁelds and hop-poles.

The Magpie is chieﬂy glossy black, showing purple and green reﬂections;
but the rump is whitish-grey; the scapulars white, the inner webs of the primaries
with a white patch; the tail with greenish-bronze and purple reﬂections, and with
a purplish-black subterminal band; abdomen snow-white: bill and feet black, iris
dark brown. Female slightly smaller and duller than the male, and with a
slightly shorter and heavier bill. Young birds somewhat duller than adults.
