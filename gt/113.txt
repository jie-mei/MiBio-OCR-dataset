The male Yellow Bunting in breeding plumage appears to vary considerably
in beauty of plumage, the birds of Mid-Kent appearing almost like a distinct
species from those of North-west Kent, owing to the much greater development
of yellow on the head. The crown and nape bright Canary-yellow, with an olive-
brown streak across the forehead and bounding the sides of the crown; * or lemon-
yellow much more streaked with olive-brown; remainder of upper parts chestnut,
the feathers of the mantle and back with strongly marked black longitudinal
streaks; wing-coverts and inner secondaries dark smoky-brown, bordered with
chestnut; remaining secondaries and primaries sooty-blackish, with more or less
yellow margins to the outer webs and slightly ashy tips: two central tail feathers
dark smoky-brown, with pale cinnamon-brownish borders; remaining feathers sooty-
blackish, with very narrow yellowish edging to the outer web; the two outer
feathers with large snow-white wedge-shaped patches on the inner web; under
parts lemon-yellow, an olive-brown streak partly bounding the ear-coverts; breast
and flanks slightly washed with olive and streaked with olive-brown; beak dark
horn-brown on the culmen, becoming more leaden at the sides, lower mandible
much paler, especially along the edge and just in front of the chin; feet pale
flesh-brown; iris hazel. The female is much less yellow than the male (excepting
in pairs netted in West Kent which, even in breeding plumage, differ compara-
tively little) the yellow on the crown represented by irregular mottling; the
chestnut of the upper parts much less pronounced, excepting on the rump and
upper tail-coverts; whilst the olive-brown streaking of the under parts is more
defined. After the autumn moult the feathers of the head have dark tips and the
other feathers of the upper parts somewhat ashy margins; all of which are said
to be shed in the spring. The young nearly resemble females in winter plumage.

I have repeatedly tried to get hold of Yellow Hammers in brilliant plumage;
but, living on the borders of North-west Kent, I find that the catchers invariably
bring me dull-plumaged birds; the more intelligent of them have assured me that
they have never seen a brightly-coloured male Yellow Hammer in the neighbour-
hood, which exactly agrees with my own experience. In the males of North Kent,
on the other hand, all the males are especially fine in colouring, the dark markings
on their heads being so much reduced as to be indiscernible at a short distance.

The Yellow Hammer is abundant in all open country, but more especially in
the better cultivated districts where one sees the males dotted here and there like
sentinels on the topmost sprays of the hedges, or sailing with rapid undulating
flight down the lanes and country roads; in wild moorland and commons this bird
