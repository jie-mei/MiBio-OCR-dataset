brought to England, and liberated when the discovery was made that (being a
female) it had no song.

This species occurred in Sussex in November, 1869, and three examples were
shot in Kent in 1902; in December, 1907, and January, 1908 a pair were shot in
Sussex.

Family—ALAUDIDÆ.

THE BLACK LARK.

Melanocorypha yeltoniensis, FORST.

A FLOCK of this species visited the south-east of England in January, 1907,
three examples having been obtained. About that time it appears that
many, imported from the Continent, were on sale in Leadenhall Market.
Larks, Ortolans, and Quails are generally sent over in long “runners,” which
include perhaps, from sixty to a hundred birds, almost as closely packed together
as bullocks in a cattle-truck. The jerking open of the door of one of these
runners, or the partial smashing in of its roof during a rough sea, would at once
liberate enough birds to form quite a respectable ﬂock. No doubt such accidents
do sometimes occur with importations of birds, and thus the British list is
enriched by man-assisted immigrants.
