bird, is quarrelsome, spiteful, and can on no account be trusted in an aviary with
any species weaker than itself. It is, moreover, fully as much trouble to its
owner in respect of food as many a far more attractive species: yet, according to the
late Rev. H. A. Macpherson, it has one merit; although its own song is insig-
nificant, the Hawfinch is not wholly destitute of the imitative faculty. In my
friend the late Charles A. Witchell's interesting work on the "Evolution of Bird-
song," we read (p. 172): "Even so poor a songster as the Hawfinch will imitate
when a captive. The Rev. H. A. Macpherson imforms me that they will pick up
any sounds."

Nevertheless, when a bird has no beauty of form, and when its colouring is
little superior to that of a hen Chaffinch, its song should compensate for other
deficiencies; and, as Major Alexander von Homeyer remarks (Gefiederte Welt,
Vol. XX, p. 489) the cherry-kernel biter is "not gifted with natural song."

It appears to me that, in dealing with British birds, it is far more convenient
to introduce the Bullfinches (the so-called Grosbeaks) immediately after the true
Grosbeaks: in their habits they are not dissimilar; whereas, to place them, as
Howard Saunders has done in his "Manual," between the more slender-billed
Finches and the Buntings, seems rather unnatural: I have, therefore, not followed
him in this respect.

There is not the least doubt that, so far as their habits are concerned, the
most typical Finches (that is the members of the genus Fringilla) approach far
more closely to the Buntings than any other species of the Subfamily, and next
to Fringilla, I should consider Passer (in spite of its aberrant nest) to show
relationship to the Emberizin√¶: I speak as an Aviculturist of course, and do not
venture to criticize the classification from a structural standpoint.
