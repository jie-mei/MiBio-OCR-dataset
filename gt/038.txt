general pet: his cage was kept in a small spare room, the wire door being usually
left open, so that he could go out and in at pleasure; every day, as soon as I
returned from town, I used to run up and call him, and he would at once fly to
me and nestle down in my hand. Towards the end of his life he appeared to feel
the cold, and usually retired early to his cocoa-nut nest, but he generally tumbled
out as soon as he heard my footstep. Two days before he died his cage door was
shut and he had got into his snuggery, but I called out, "Well little chap, how

door: I opened it, stepped back to the end of the room and called him, and he
immediately flew across as usual.

I don't think I was ever more fond of any pet than I was of that House-
Martin, and I felt his death acutely: but, nevertheless, I do not recommend the
species as a cage-bird; its wings are so long, and its legs so short, that the
primaries constantly get dragged through the dirt and need frequently cleansing,
which tends to give the birds cold. A long and well-warmed corridor would make
a suitable aviary for them.*

Cotile riparia, LINN.

OF the distribution of this bird outside the British Islands, Howard Saunders
writes:-"In the Faroes and Iceland the Sand-Martin has not yet been
obtained, but on the Continent it is generally distributed from 70° N.
lat. to the Mediterranean in summer; while it also breeds sparingly in the
northern districts of Africa, and abundantly in Egypt and Palestine. Eastward,
