to be the case with Pycnonotus leucotis the Persian specimens of which have a fine
variable liquid song, whereas the smaller examples found in N.W. India are very
poor singers. Judging by Jerdon's account, the Crested Lark of India can be
little inferior to the Mongolian or Tientsin Lark, the song of which, though it
contains some harsh scolding notes, is exceedingly amusing and in some of its
phrases really fine. My advice to aviculturists would, therefore, be, not to accept
Mr. Rausch's decision as final; but, if they desire to keep the Crested Lark,
import it from India, or even from Pekin, where according to Pére David (P.Z.S.
1871, p. 390) it is resident and common, as it also is in Mongolia.

In India this bird, according to Jerdon (cf. Cat. Birds, E. Ind. Comp.,
vol. II, p. 466) "feeds on various insects, chiefly grasshoppers, and in default of
this food, on grain and seeds." This supports the statement made by Seebohm:
-"The food of the Crested Lark does not differ from that of its congeners. In
the spring and summer it is chiefly composed of insects and larvæ, and in the
autumn and winter of various small seeds and grain." It is exactly what one
would expect. In captivity it should have soft food, seeds (Canary and millet),
also insects, mealworms, etc.

THE WHITE-WINGED LARK.

Melanocorypha sibirica, GMEL.

THIS species was admitted into the British list in consequence of a female
having been captured alive near Brighton, on November 22nd, 1869, and
exhibited by Mr. G. Dawson Rowley at a meeting of the Zoological
Society, held Jan. 27th, 1870. It is a common Russian species; and, by anyone
acquainted with the allied Mongolian Lark, is exceedingly likely to have been
