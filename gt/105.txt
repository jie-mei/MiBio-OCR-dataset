ing, and sang regularly in the spring: unfortunately I kept this example in a
cage, and, at its third moult, all its quills grew out like fans, giving the bird
a most wild and uncanny aspect; indeed it was such an object that I gave it
away to some poor child who took a fancy to it.

About 1889 I again purchased a Brambling from a bird-catcher, and turned
it into a good-sized aviary with other British species: it soon became fairly tame,
sang well each spring, and rarely made itself objectionable to its associates; it
lived principally upon seed, but ate a certain amount of soft food and any chance
insects which were thrown to it. The plumage of this bird was so perfect that a
friend who greatly desired to have it for show-purposes persuaded me to let him
purchase it.

Bramblings have not only bred in confinement, but have been successfully
crossed with Chaffinches. The Natural History Museum at Florence contains
several hybrids between the Brambling and Chaffinch. These specimens show
ample evidence of their origin, and were netted in a wild state by the Italian
bird-catchers.

IN February 1905, a male was shot at Rye Harbour, Sussex. It has occurred
twice at Heligoland, once in the north of France, and several times in
Germany.
