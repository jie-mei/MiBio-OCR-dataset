APPENDIX.

WHEN I was asked to prepare the first volume of this work for the press,
I was already busily engaged upon the preparation of two other books,
one of which was published about a fortnight before the said first
volume appeared, the other being still in hand as I write. It need, therefore, be
a matter of no surprise to my readers, that I was unable, for lack of time, to
ferret out particulars respecting all the recent accidental visitors to our shores-
some of them, doubtless, man-assisted immigrants, or that I overlooked some extra
occurrences of visitors already recorded in British Bird books. Had the admirable
articles by the late Howard Saunders, and by Messrs. H. F. Witherby and N.
F. Ticehurst been then published, I admit that it would have been better to
include all these vagrants (as has been done in the present volume), but, under
the circumstances, it was impossible for me to devote the necessary time to
elaborate this subject. This has been most ably accomplished in the first volume
of that excellent magazine-"British Birds," by the above-mentioned gentlemen.

As one reviewer of my first volume considered me very remiss in not bringing
the list of chance visitors up-to-date (though each year adds to the list), I propose
to remedy the deficiency here as far as possible, though it is impossible to keep
pace with the constantly published records of occurrences.
