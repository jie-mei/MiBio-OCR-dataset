The Lesser Redpoll in conﬁnement is for ever ﬁdgeting about on the wirework
of its cage, somewhat after the fashion of a Tit: during the breeding season the
male and female spend half the day in caressing like a pair of Love-birds; whilst
the song of the male at that season is frequent, but is a very poor performance,
not unlike a feeble Brambling’s song, consisting (as already hinted) of a mere
monotonous trill, resembling a distant railway-guard’s whistle: this trill is some‐
times copied by young Canaries, and is considered ruination to their notes.

My experience of this species in an aviary is that no Finch of its size is so
mischievously meddlesome as the Lesser Redpoll; not only does it rarely breed,
but if another bird which happens to be building, leaves its nest for fresh material,
the Redpoll immediately ﬂies down and commences to pull it to pieces. On the
other hand, Mr. G. C. Swailes, of Beverley, has been rather succesful in breeding
Redpolls.

The ﬁrst Redpolls I ever had, cost me about three shillings for the pair;
but I soon discovered that I had paid at least three times their value, inasmuch as
the price asked by bird-catchers for equally good birds varied at that time from eight-
pence to a shilling the pair: altogether I have had a good many, and yet never
cared much for them: it is true that they very soon grow tame, although never so
completely so as Siskins; but after their ﬁrst moult in close conﬁnement all the
crimson and rose colouring disappears and never returns, the forehead becoming
yellowish; and even in an aviary it goes after their second moult, so that a very
soberly clad, restless, inquisitive little bird, with no proper song, but a large appetite,
is all that remains.

Herr Gätke’s account of a pair of Redpolls which nested in his garden in
Heligoland is rather puzzling: he speaks of only discovering the nest in the
autumn when the leaves were falling, yet is sure of the identity of the species
from the fact that on one occasion he picked up two of the young birds, and
restored them to their home amongst the elder branches. Can the Redpolls have
been breeding in the autumn?
