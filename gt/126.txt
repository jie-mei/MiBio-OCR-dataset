Emberiza pusilla, PALLAS.

ONE specimen was captured near Brighton, on November 2nd, 1864; a female
was secured in Durham and a male in Warwick in 1902, one was caught
by a cat in Scotland in 1903, an example was seen at Fair Isle in 1905,
and a female secured in 1906; all these examples were met with in October.
At best it can only be regarded as a rare and chance wanderer to Great
Britain, although there is no reason why it should not occasionally visit us.
