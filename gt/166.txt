snaps at her tail again; the mystification and rage of the cat are exceedingly
ludicrous, as also is the adroit way in which the Jackdaw invariably evades her.

The keenness of vision of the Jackdaw is perhaps never so much appreciated
as when one experiments with a tame example. For many years my old friend
Dr. John Grayling, of Sittingbourne, had a tame Jackdaw in his garden. This
bird was particularly fond of hazel-nuts, and would catch every one that was
thrown at him; but if you took two or three nuts with about the same number
of pebbles in your hand, and flung them at the bird, one after the other as rapidly
as possible, he caught every nut, and evaded every stone, without fail: his
manner of avoiding a missile made you look small, for he never moved farther
than was necessary, sometimes merely lowering his head, or taking a step to right
or left.* When one considers how marvellously powerful a bird's vision must be
to enable it, in a second, to distinguish between a nut and a similarly-coloured
pebble, leading it instantaneously to decide whether to catch or avoid it; it seems
preposterous to imagine that it can ever hesitate as to the nature of a leaf-like
insect, however well it may seem to be disguised to our less discriminating sight:
indeed I am fully convinced that if a dozen leaf-like insects (recently killed to
prevent their showing movement) and an equal number of similar crumpled leaves
were flung on the floor of an aviary containing insectivorous birds of any kind,
it would not be long before all the insects had been selected and devoured.

As the Jackdaw is almost omnivorous, there is never any difficulty in feeding
it in captivity: but the bird is less entertaining in a flight-cage than when (with
one wing clipped) it is allowed the run of the place.
