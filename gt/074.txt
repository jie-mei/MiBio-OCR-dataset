take our small, dark Lesser Redpoll separately.” As this appears to me to be
the most reasonable course to pursue, I shall do the same. Dr. Sharpe regards
the Lesser Redpoll (A. rufescens) as a subspecies of A. linaria, but distinguishes

A. hornemanni as a subspecies of A. exilipes, the latter being considered a diﬀerent
species from the Mealy Redpoll, on account of its greyer rump. When no two
Ornithologists agree as to the limits of various closely-related types, the evidence
in favour of these all belonging to one species would seem to be very strong
indeed. Nevertheless, as regards Great Britain, the two Redpolls usually met with
are suﬃciently distinct to be separately treated.

Dr. Sharpe gives the distribution of our Mealy Redpoll as:—“Northern Europe,
across Siberia to North America, wintering in more southern localities.”

To Great Britain this bird is a more or less irregular winter visitor; Howard
Saunders states that it “is a regular winter visitor to Shetland, from September
onwards, and the track of its migration appears to be principally along the east
coast in Scotland, and the north of England, for the bird is rarer, and of more
uncertain occurrence on the west side. South of Durham its visits become
irregular; in the eastern counties it has occasionally been obtained in spring, and
exceptionally in summer; and in some years large ﬂocks have been noticed down
to the Channel; but in Cornwall it is as yet unknown. In Ireland an example
was taken in co. Kildare, in February, 1876.” (Manual British Birds, p. 182).
An example was shot at Achill Island, co. Mayo, according to F. Coburu, Bull.
