THE BLACK‐HEADED BUNTING.

Emberiza melanocephala, SCOP.

IN spite of the fact that the Black-headed Bunting has hardly any claim to be
called a British bird, it is necessary to give an account and illustration of it,

in order that the confusion existing in the minds of many, respecting this
species and the Reed Bunting, may be abolished.

Dr. Sharpe summarizes the distribution of this bird as follows:—“Southern
Europe from Asia Minor and Greece, westwards to Southern Germany and Southern
France, eastwards to North-western and Central India.” Howard Saunders says:—
“In Greece, Turkey, the Danubian Provinces, Southern Russia, Asia Minor, Pales‐
tine, and Northern Persia, it is common from the end of April to autumn, after
which it leaves for its winter quarters in North-western and Central India.”

Gätke, speaking of it in Heligoland observes:—“I obtained the ﬁrst example
of this large and handsome Bunting on the 4th of June, 1845; it is an old male
in which, singularly, the normal black markings of the head not only extend
downwards along the sides of the neck, but the fore-neck also has a long black
longitudinal patch. Since that time the species has occurred here about ﬁfteen
times, and has been killed in most of these cases.”

When Seebohm published his History of British Birds, Vol. II, in 1884, only
one example of this species had been obtained, it was shot by Mr. Robert Brazener,
on Brighton racecourse, on the 3rd November, 1868. In 1888, Howard Saunders
was able to add two occurrences of the Black-headed Bunting (Manual British
Birds, p. 197) one recorded by the Rev. J. R. Ashworth (in the “Zoologist” for
1886, p. 73) as having been shot in Nottinghamshire; and the other as having
been captured about November 5th, 1886, near Dunfermline, and exhibited at the
Crystal Palace Show, February 12th to 17th, 1887, where it was recognized by
the late Rev. H. A. Macpherson. It was then purchased by Mr. J. C. Steele, of
Beckenham, who exhibited it at the Palace every year up to 1891, taking a ﬁrst
prize up to 1890. In 1891 it was recognized and labelled as “Black-headed
Bunting” by the late Mr. Jenner Weir at the West Kent Ornithological Show;
but, knowing that the carelessness of some popular writers had prejudiced the
