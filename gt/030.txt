other Flycatchers, breeding in beech‐woods, and only visiting gardens in their
vicinity. The song is said by Seebohm to be very unobtrusive and intermediate
between those of the Robin and Redstart, and he describes the alarm‐note as pink,
pink, pink, something like the spink of a Chaﬃnch; probably Naumann's call-note
of this species is the same sound, and he expresses it ”füid, füid,” I, therefore,
have no doubt that the true rendering of the note would be “phwick” or “phwit”;
for no Chaﬃnch ever had a note the least bit like spink or pink, and t, not d, is
one of the terminal sounds in bird‐notes: Dr. A. Walter, according to Gätke,
describes the call as a rattling sound, but doubtless the latter would be a scolding
note.

In its actions the Red-breasted Flycatcher resembles our other species, some‐
times it pursues its prey in the air, but sometimes it picks them from the trunk
of a tree: in addition to insects it also eats small fruits.

The nest is usually placed in a beech‐tree, either in a cavity, in trunk, or
branch, or against the trunk, supported by outgrowing twigs; in form it is a
somewhat deep cup, formed of moss, a few fragments of lichen, and a few soft
feathers; the lining of fine bents and hairs. The number of the eggs varies from
ﬁve to seven, bluish‐green, more or less mottled or speckled with rusty‐brown,
sometime so densely as almost to conceal the ground‐colour, and with greyish‐brown
shell‐markings: in character they are intermediate between those of the Spotted
Flycatcher and the Robin.

This bird is said to be almost as pugnacious as a Robin; therefore it would
be well to use caution in associating it with other species in an aviary. As a
cage‐bird it has been both kept and exhibited in Germany, and if reared from the
nest would doubtless be very tame and make a most attractive pet, feeding readily
on the usual soft food; Seebohm, however, states that “birds of this species in
conﬁnement feed upon the common house‐fly with great avidity, preferring it to
any artiﬁcial food.” Doubtless this statement is correct, but it would be quite out
of the question to attempt to feed this, or any other bird upon ﬂies alone.
