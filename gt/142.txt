hatched, the three young birds would have been able to sit comfortably in the
pipe, and it is doubtful whether they could have easily escaped from it.

Nidification lasts from April to June; in mild seasons the first nests being
commenced towards the end of March; two broods are sometimes reared in a year,
and it is not very rare to find two hens in charge of one nest, in which case
seven, eight, or even more eggs will be found together:* this I have proved on
more than one occasion, but only in the case of nests built under thatching, where
I flushed both hens from the same hole, as I rested my ladder against the roof,
and putting in my hand felt the whole of the double clutch in the one depression:
so far as I could make out, only one male owned the nest and its two occupants.

The food of the Starling consists during the breeding-season of worms, slugs,
leather-jackets (the larv√¶ of crane-flies) and many other destructive grubs; also
of spiders and various insects; indeed these are always eaten when procurable,
but in autumn fruit and the softer berries are devoured, whilst in winter hips
and haws, and seeds of many kinds, as well as all kinds of household scraps are
greedily swallowed.

In the autumn Starlings collect into immense flocks, consisting of hundreds
of thousands, if not millions of individuals; as they pass overhead, wheeling in
an immense circle, the sound of their wings is like the rushing of water, and the
earth is darkened below as by a heavy passing cloud. I have seen two or three
of these vast assemblages following one another and wheeling incessantly over a
large park in Kent; and, when at length they drew out into a long continuous
belt and gradually settled, the trees were black with birds.

In captivity the Starling rapidly becomes friendly and is always amusing, but
he is a ravenous bird with a powerful digestion, and, therefore, needs constant
attention if kept in a cage: an aviary is the place in which to see him to perfec-
tion: there he is always perfect in plumage excepting when moulting, for he is
constantly bathing and preening his feathers.

I reared my first nest of young Starlings in May, 1887, feeding them on a
moistened mixture of oat-flour and pea-meal: they were no trouble to rear, but
very noisy, greedy, and quarrelsome. When full grown one of these birds used
to spend nearly the whole day in turning back-somersaults from the top perch of
his cage to the bottom one, or to the floor, and back again: I used to wonder
whether it had a diseased brain, but it seemed quite sensible in other respects:
another of these birds distinguished itself by singing incessantly right up to
November: its performance consisted of a comical jumble of chuckling sounds,
mixed with a few Canary notes and the alarm-chatter of the Blackbird: it also
