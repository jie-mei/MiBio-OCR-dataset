THE MARTIN.

Chelidon urbica, LINN.

THE House-Martin breeds throughout Europe, ranging even further north than
the Swallow. Seebohm says of it:-"It occasionally straggles to the Canaries
and Madeira, and breeds abundantly in North-west Africa. In Egypt and
Nubia it is only known on migration; but it breeds in Palestine, Asia Minor,
and Persia. Scarcely anything is known of its winter quarters, which probably
are somewhere in Central Africa. A few birds are supposed to winter in Algeria,
and stragglers are said to occur in Turkestan and India."

Generally distributed throughout Great Britain, with the exception of the
Outer Hebrides.

The adult Martin has the upper parts to the rump glossy blue-black; the
rump, inner tail-coverts, and under parts pure white; wings and tail brownish-
