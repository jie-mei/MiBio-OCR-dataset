THE MARTIN.

Chelidon urbica, LINN.

THE House-Martin breeds throughout Europe, ranging even further north than
the Swallow. Seebohm says of it:—“It occasionally straggles to the Canaries
and Madeira, and breeds abundantly in North-west Africa. In Egypt and
Nubia it is only known on migration; but it breeds in Palestine, Asia Minor,

Generally distributed throughout Great Britain, with the exception of the

The adult Martin has the upper parts to the rump glossy blue-black; the
