still fonder of spiders, and this fact should, I think, be taken into account when
summing up the virtues and vices of birds. If man would let nature alone, he
would ﬁnd the balance perfect, but he interferes everywhere and makes a mess of it.

In autumn and winter the Yellow Bunting feeds largely upon grain and seeds
of weeds, wandering over the country in ﬂocks in company with Chaﬃnches,
Bramblings, etc.

Although a beautiful bird, the wild caught Yellow Hammer never commands
a high price, bird-catchers generally being well satisﬁed to receive a shilling for
a pair: the fact that the bird is not a ﬁne singer partly accounts for this, but the
wildness of newly caught specimens is another serious drawback to the popularity
of this species; inasmuch as, after weeks of conﬁnement, it still rattles about its
cage whenever it is approached, uttering a whining sort of chirp. An aviary suits
it far better.

In October, 1888, I purchased a pair from a bird-catcher, and turned them
into a large covered aviary: in the succeeding spring they built a typical nest
in an Arbor-vitœ; but, as already related previously, a hen Hedge-Sparrow took
possession of this nest as soon as it was completed, and subsequently the unhappy
Buntings were a long time in deciding upon a new building-site; towards the
end of July they selected a very damp corner on the ground behind a marsh-ﬂag
and began to build; they, however, never ﬁnished this nest, but continued to
carry about hay and straw in an undecided desultory manner until November,
when they ﬁnally gave it up as a bad job. Early in 1890, both birds died:
possibly they did not receive suﬃcient insect-food to keep them in good health.

Cases have been recorded in which this species has been discovered sitting
upon eggs deposited in a slight depression on the bare ground; there is no doubt
that the explanation of such behaviour is—that its nest has been taken. I once
removed a nest with three eggs from a hedge, and passing a day or two later saw
the bird sitting on a little platform of ivy twigs upon which the nest had been
partly supported; as I approached she ﬂew away, disclosing her fourth egg.
