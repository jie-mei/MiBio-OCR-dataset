objects less conspicuous to the uninterested onlooker, and, therefore, may be in a
measure protective, is probable; but that it exists with any deﬁnite intention, is
no more than a guess.

Lord Lilford’s view as to the site usually selected for the nest of the Reed
Bunting coincides with my own limited experience, for he says:—“All the nests
which we have met with were situated on the ground, or the crust formed by
the roots of the common reed.” Hewitson, however, in the third edition of his
“Eggs of British Birds,” observes:—I have, though rarely, found them at an
elevation of two feet or more above the water, and supported by a branch of the
common reed, not ﬁxed like the nest of the Reed-Warbler, attached to the perpen‐
dicular stems, but supported upon a bunch of them which had been prostrated
by the wind.” Sometimes the nest is placed in young spruce ﬁrs, and it is
often found in herbage on a bank.

The materials of the nest seem to vary considerably; all mine are formed
of ﬁne dead grasses and a few bents, or coarser bents with a blade or two of
broad-grass; and are lined with very ﬁne grass and horsehairs, or ﬁne grass
alone. Stevenson’s nests seem to have been formed of ﬁne bents and lined with
the feathery tops of reeds. Lord Lilford’s were composed of moss and sedge,
with a lining of reed tops, and sometimes a little hair. Seebohm mentions
withered leaves of rushes as one of the materials employed, and Howard Saunders
speaks of withered ﬂags. The eggs number from four to six, and are of various
stone tints varying between pale brownish-lavender and olivaceous-buﬀ; blotched,
spotted, speckled, and often more or less boldly streaked with purplish-black, the
underlying spots appearing a lavender-grey: they have the opaque appearance
characteristic of eggs of the Chaﬃnch, but more nearly resemble one variety of
those of the Tree Pipit.

The nesting-season usually commences late in April or early in May, though
Lord Lilford mentions having taken a full nest as early as March 23rd, and as
from two to three broods are reared, nidiﬁcation must continue until at least the
end of July, if not to the middle of August. It has been stated that the male
takes part in incubating the eggs, but I have not had suﬃcient experience of
this species to be able to dogmatise on the point. As a rule it is engaged in
singing its poor song, while the hen sits near by; and when the nest is dis‐
covered both birds try to divert the attention of the intruder by tumbling about,
as if wounded upon the earth. The song consists of a few monotonous notes
cheo, cheo, cheo, chee, chee, chee, chee, and terminates with a harsh zshwee; the call-
note is said to be tschee, and Mr. Witchell states that he has heard another note,
resembling the battle-cry of the Chaﬃnch.
